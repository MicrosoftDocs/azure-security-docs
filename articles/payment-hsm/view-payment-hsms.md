# Tutorial: View your payment HSMs

After you [create one or more Azure Payment HSMs](create-payment-hsm.md), you can view them (and validate their deployment) with Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

## View your payment HSM

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To list all of your payment HSMs, use the [az dedicated-hsm list](/cli/azure/dedicated-hsm#az-dedicated-hsm-list) command. (The output of this command is more readable when displayed in table-format.)

```azurecli-interactive
az dedicated-hsm list --resource-group "myResourceGroup" -o table
```

To see a specific payment HSM and its properties, use the Azure CLI [az dedicated-hsm show](/cli/azure/dedicated-hsm#az-dedicated-hsm-show) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az dedicated-hsm show --resource-group "myResourceGroup" --name "myPaymentHSM"
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To list all of your payment HSMs, use the [Get-AzDedicatedHsm](/powershell/module/az.dedicatedhsm/get-azdedicatedhsm) cmdlet with no parameters.

To get more information on your payment HSMs, you can use the [Get-AzResource](/powershell/module/az.dedicatedhsm/get-azdedicatedhsm) cmdlet, specifying the resource group, and "Microsoft.HardwareSecurityModules/dedicatedHSMs" as the resource type:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -ResourceType "Microsoft.HardwareSecurityModules/dedicatedHSMs"
```

To view a specific payment HSM and its properties, use the Azure PowerShell [Get-AzDedicatedHsm](/powershell/module/az.dedicatedhsm/get-azdedicatedhsm) cmdlet.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzDedicatedHsm -Name "myPaymentHSM" -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup"
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To view your payment HSMs in the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select "Resource groups".
1. Select your resource group (for example, "myResourceGroup").
1. Your network interfaces will appear. To view your payment HSMs as well, select the "Show hidden types" box.

To view the IP addresses of the host and management network interfaces, see the "connected devices" associated with your Virtual Network:

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select "Virtual networks".
1. Select your virtual network (for example, "myVNet").
1. From the left-hand sidebar, select "Connected devices".
