> The payment HSM must be in a Secure state before RELEASE button is enabled. To do this, login with both Left and Right Keys and change state to Secure.

## Delete the payment HSM

Once the payment HSM is released, you can delete it using Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To remove your payment HSM, use the [az dedicated-hsm delete](/cli/azure/dedicated-hsm#az-dedicated-hsm-delete) command. The following example deletes the `myPaymentHSM` payment HSM from the `myResourceGroup` resource group:

```azurecli-interactive
az dedicated-hsm delete --name "myPaymentHSM" -g "myResourceGroup"
```

Afterward, you can verify that the payment HSM was deleted with the Azure CLI [az dedicated-hsm show](/cli/azure/dedicated-hsm#az-dedicated-hsm-show) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az dedicated-hsm show --resource-group "myResourceGroup" --name "myPaymentHSM"
```

This returns a "resource not found" error.

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To remove your payment HSM, use the Azure PowerShell [Remove-AzDedicatedHsm](/powershell/module/az.dedicatedhsm/remove-azdedicatedhsm) cmdlet. The following example deletes the `myPaymentHSM` payment HSM from the `myResourceGroup` resource group:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzDedicatedHsm -Name "myPaymentHSM" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
```

Afterward, you can verify that the payment HSM was deleted with the Azure PowerShell [Get-AzDedicatedHsm](/powershell/module/az.dedicatedhsm/get-azdedicatedhsm) cmdlet.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzDedicatedHsm -Name "myPaymentHSM" -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup"
```

This returns a "resource not found" error.
