# Tutorial: Use a VPN to access the payShield manager for your payment HSM

After you [Create an Azure Payment HSM](create-payment-hsm.md), you can connect to its payShield manager through your browser.

To connect to payShield manager, you need to have an on-premises, standard PC with a supported web-browser, together with the USB connected payShield Manager Reader and payShield Manager smart cards. Users connect to the payShield 10K via HTTP(s) using a configured management NIC IP address.

You need a minimum of five smart cards (three cards for a CTA set, a Left Key Card and a Right Key Card) and one reader.  See Thales's payShield 10K Installation and User Guide for the detailed instructions.

## Sample deployment scenarios

Here are two sample scenarios for connecting to payShield manager for your payment HSM.

Microsoft maintains a base firmware across the fleet, you can check the base firmware version from the HSM allocated, or check the [support guide](support-guide.md). You must upgrade the firmware based on your requirements.
