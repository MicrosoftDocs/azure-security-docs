# Enable Key Vault logging

After you create one or more key vaults, you'll likely want to monitor how and when your key vaults are accessed, and by whom. For full details on the feature, see [Azure Key Vault logging](logging.md).

What is logged:

* All authenticated REST API requests, including failed requests as a result of access permissions, system errors, or bad requests.
* Operations on the key vault itself, including creation, deletion, setting key vault access policies, and updating key vault attributes such as tags.
* Operations on keys and secrets in the key vault, including:
  * Creating, modifying, or deleting these keys or secrets.
  * Signing, verifying, encrypting, decrypting, wrapping and unwrapping keys, getting secrets, and listing keys and secrets (and their versions).
* Unauthenticated requests that result in a 401 response. Examples are requests that lack a bearer token, are malformed or expired, or have an invalid token.  
* Azure Event Grid notification events for the following conditions: expired, near expiration, and changed vault access policy (the new version event isn't logged). Events are logged even if there's an event subscription created on the key vault. For more information, see [Azure Key Vault as Event Grid source](/azure/event-grid/event-schema-key-vault).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need an Azure key vault. You can create a new key vault using one of these methods:
  - [Create a key vault using the Azure CLI](quick-create-cli.md)
  - [Create a key vault using Azure PowerShell](quick-create-powershell.md)
  - [Create a key vault using the Azure portal](quick-create-portal.md)

You'll also need a destination for your logs.  The destination can be an existing or new Azure storage account and/or Log Analytics workspace.

You can create a new Azure storage account using one of these methods:
  - [Create a storage account using the Azure CLI](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-cli)
  - [Create a storage account using Azure PowerShell](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-powershell)
  - [Create a storage account using the Azure portal](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)

You can create a new Log Analytics workspace using one of these methods:
  - [Create a Log Analytics workspace using the Azure CLI](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace?tabs=azure-cli)
  - [Create a Log Analytics workspace using Azure PowerShell](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace?tabs=azure-powershell)
  - [Create a Log Analytics workspace the Azure portal](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace?tabs=azure-portal)

## Connect to your Key Vault subscription

The first step in setting up key logging is connecting to the subscription containing your key vault, if you have multiple subscriptions associated with your account.

With the Azure CLI, you can view all your subscriptions by using the [az account list](/cli/azure/account#az-account-list) command. Then you connect to one by using the [az account set](/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az account list

az account set --subscription "<subscriptionID>"
```

With Azure PowerShell, you can first list your subscriptions by using the [Get-AzSubscription](/powershell/module/az.accounts/get-azsubscription) cmdlet. Then you connect to one by using the [Set-AzContext](/powershell/module/az.accounts/set-azcontext) cmdlet: 

```powershell-interactive
Get-AzSubscription

Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<subscriptionID>"
```

## Obtain resource IDs

To enable logging on a key vault, you'll need the resource ID of the key vault and the destination (Azure Storage or Log Analytics account).

If you can't remember the name of your key vault, you can use the Azure CLI [az keyvault list](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-list) command, or the Azure PowerShell [Get-AzKeyVault](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvault) cmdlet, to find it.

Use the name of your key vault to find its resource ID. With the Azure CLI, use the [az keyvault show](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-show) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault show --name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>"
```

With Azure PowerShell, use the [Get-AzKeyVault](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvault) cmdlet.

```powershell-interactive
Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName "<your-unique-keyvault-name>"
```

The resource ID for your key vault is in the following format: "/subscriptions/*your-subscription-ID*/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/*your-unique-keyvault-name*. Note it for the next step.

## Enable logging

You can enable logging for Key Vault by using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

### Azure CLI

Use the Azure CLI [az monitor diagnostic-settings create](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings) command, the storage account ID, and the key vault resource ID, as follows:

```azurecli-interactive
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --storage-account "<storage-account-id>" --resource "<key-vault-resource-id>" --name "Key vault logs" --logs '[{"category": "AuditEvent","enabled": true}]' --metrics '[{"category": "AllMetrics","enabled": true}]'
```

Optionally, you can set a retention policy for your logs, so that older logs are automatically deleted after a specified amount of time. For example, you might set a retention policy that automatically deletes logs older than 90 days.

With the Azure CLI, use the [az monitor diagnostic-settings update](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings#az-monitor-diagnostic-settings-update) command. 

```azurecli-interactive
az monitor diagnostic-settings update --name "Key vault retention policy" --resource "<key-vault-resource-id>" --set retentionPolicy.days=90
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use the [Set-AzDiagnosticSetting](/powershell/module/az.monitor/set-azdiagnosticsetting) cmdlet, with the `-Enabled` flag set to `$true` and the `category` set to `AuditEvent` (the only category for Key Vault logging):

```powershell-interactive
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId "<key-vault-resource-id>" -StorageAccountId $sa.id -Enabled $true -Category "AuditEvent"
```

Optionally, you can set a retention policy for your logs, so that older logs are automatically deleted after a specified amount of time. For example, you might set a retention policy that automatically deletes logs older than 90 days.

With Azure PowerShell, use the [Set-AzDiagnosticSetting](/powershell/module/az.monitor/set-azdiagnosticsetting) cmdlet.

```powershell-interactive
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting "<key-vault-resource-id>" -StorageAccountId $sa.id -Enabled $true -Category AuditEvent -RetentionEnabled $true -RetentionInDays 90
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To configure diagnostic settings in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. From the **Resource** pane menu, select **Diagnostic settings**, and then  **Add diagnostic setting**

   :::image type="content" source="../media/diagnostics-portal-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select diagnostic settings.":::

1. Under **Category groups**, select both **audit** and **allLogs**. 
1. If Azure Log Analytics is the destination, select **Send to Log Analytics workspace** and choose your subscription and workspace from the drop-down menus. You may also select **Archive to a storage account** and choose your subscription and storage account from the drop-down menus.

## Access your logs

Your Key Vault logs are in the *insights-logs-auditevent* container in the storage account that you provided. To view the logs, you have to download blobs.

First, list all the blobs in the container.  With the Azure CLI, use the [az storage blob list](/cli/azure/storage/blob#az-storage-blob-list) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage blob list --account-name "<your-unique-storage-account-name>" --container-name "insights-logs-auditevent"
```

With Azure PowerShell, use [Get-AzStorageBlob](/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageblob). To list all the blobs in this container, enter:

```powershell
Get-AzStorageBlob -Container "insights-logs-auditevent" -Context $sa.Context
```

From the output of either the Azure CLI command or the Azure PowerShell cmdlet, you can see that the names of the blobs are in the following format: `resourceId=<ARM resource ID>/y=<year>/m=<month>/d=<day of month>/h=<hour>/m=<minute>/filename.json`. The date and time values use Coordinated Universal Time.

Because you can use the same storage account to collect logs for multiple resources, the full resource ID in the blob name is useful to access or download just the blobs that you need.

But first, download all the blobs. With the Azure CLI, use the [az storage blob download](/cli/azure/storage/blob#az-storage-blob-download) command, pass it the names of the blobs, and the path to the file where you want to save the results.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage blob download --container-name "insights-logs-auditevent" --file <path-to-file> --name "<blob-name>" --account-name "<your-unique-storage-account-name>"
```

With Azure PowerShell, use the [Get-AzStorageBlob](/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageblob) cmdlet to get a list of the blobs. Then pipe that list to the [Get-AzStorageBlobContent](/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageblobcontent) cmdlet to download the logs to your chosen path.

```powershell-interactive
$blobs = Get-AzStorageBlob -Container "insights-logs-auditevent" -Context $sa.Context | Get-AzStorageBlobContent -Destination "<path-to-file>"
```

When you run this second cmdlet in PowerShell, the `/` delimiter in the blob names creates a full folder structure under the destination folder. You'll use this structure to download and store the blobs as files.

To selectively download blobs, use wildcards. For example:

* If you have multiple key vaults and want to download logs for just one key vault, named CONTOSOKEYVAULT3:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzStorageBlob -Container "insights-logs-auditevent" -Context $sa.Context -Blob '*/VAULTS/CONTOSOKEYVAULT3
  ```

* If you have multiple resource groups and want to download logs for just one resource group, use `-Blob '*/RESOURCEGROUPS/<resource group name>/*'`:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzStorageBlob -Container "insights-logs-auditevent" -Context $sa.Context -Blob '*/RESOURCEGROUPS/CONTOSORESOURCEGROUP3/*'
  ```

* If you want to download all the logs for the month of January 2019, use `-Blob '*/year=2019/m=01/*'`:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzStorageBlob -Container "insights-logs-auditevent" -Context $sa.Context -Blob '*/year=2016/m=01/*'
  ```

## Use Azure Monitor logs

You can use the Key Vault solution in Azure Monitor logs to review Key Vault `AuditEvent` logs. In Azure Monitor logs, you use log queries to analyze data and get the information you need.  For more information, see [Monitoring Key Vault](monitor-key-vault.md).
