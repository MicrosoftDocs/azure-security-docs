# Quickstart: Create a key vault using the Azure CLI

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for [keys](../keys/index.yml), [secrets](../secrets/index.yml), and [certificates](../certificates/index.yml). For more information on Key Vault, see [About Azure Key Vault](overview.md); for more information on what can be stored in a key vault, see [About keys, secrets, and certificates](about-keys-secrets-certificates.md).
