# Azure Key Vault .NET 2.0 - Release Notes and Migration Guide
The following information helps migrating to the 2.0 version of the Azure Key Vault library for C# and .NET. Apps written for earlier versions need to be updating to support the latest version. These changes are needed to fully support new and improved features, such as **Key Vault certificates**.

## Key Vault certificates

Key Vault certificates manage x509 certificates and supports the following behaviors:  

* Create certificates through a Key Vault creation process or import existing certificate, including both self-signed and Certificate Authority (CA) generated certificates.
* Securely store and manage x509 certificate storage without interaction using private key material.  
* Define policies that direct Key Vault to manage the certificate lifecycle.  
* Provide contact information for lifecycle events, such as expiration warnings and renewal notifications.  
* Automatically renew certificates with selected issuers (Key Vault partner X509 certificate providers and certificate authorities).* Support certificate from alternate (nonpartner) provides and certificate authorities (does not support autorenewal).  

## .NET support

* **.NET 4.0** is not supported by the 2.0 version of the Azure Key Vault .NET library
* **.NET Framework 4.5.2** is supported by the 2.0 version of the Azure Key Vault .NET library
* **.NET Standard 1.4** is supported by the 2.0 version of the Azure Key Vault .NET library

## Namespaces

* The namespace for **models** is changed from **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault** to **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Models**.
* The **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Internal** namespace is dropped.
* The following Azure SDK dependencies namespaces have 

    - **Hyak.Common** is now **Microsoft.Rest**.
    - **Hyak.Common.Internals** is now **Microsoft.Rest.Serialization**.

## Type changes

* *Secret* changed to *SecretBundle*
* *Dictionary* changed to *IDictionary*
* *List\<T>, string []* changed to *IList\<T>*
* *NextList* changed to  *NextPageLink*

## Return types

* **KeyList** and **SecretList** now returns *IPage\<T>* instead of *ListKeysResponseMessage*
* The generated **BackupKeyAsync** now returns *BackupKeyResult*, which contains *Value* (back-up blob). Previously, the method was wrapped and returned just the value.

## Exceptions

* *KeyVaultClientException* is changed to *KeyVaultErrorException*
* The service error changed from *exception.Error* to *exception.Body.Error.Message*.
* Removed additional info from the error message for **[JsonExtensionData]**.

## Constructors

* Instead of accepting an *HttpClient* as a constructor argument, the constructor only accepts *HttpClientHandler* or *DelegatingHandler[]*.
