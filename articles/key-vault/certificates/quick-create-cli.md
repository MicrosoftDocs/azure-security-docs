# Quickstart: Set and retrieve a certificate from Azure Key Vault using Azure CLI

In this quickstart, you create a key vault in Azure Key Vault with Azure CLI. Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that works as a secure secrets store. You can securely store keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets. For more information on Key Vault you may review the [Overview](../general/overview.md). Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources using commands or scripts. Once that you have completed that, you will store a certificate.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

 - This quickstart requires version 2.0.4 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group](../../../includes/cli-rg-create.md)]

## Create a key vault

[!INCLUDE [Create a key vault](../includes/key-vault-creation-cli.md)]

## Give your user account permissions to manage secrets in Key Vault

[!INCLUDE [Using RBAC to provide access to a key vault](../includes/rbac/upn-certificate-officer-cli.md)]

## Add a certificate to Key Vault

To add a certificate to the vault, you just need to take a couple of additional steps. This certificate could be used by an application. 

Type the commands below to create a self-signed certificate with default policy called **ExampleCertificate** :

```azurecli
az keyvault certificate create --vault-name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" -n ExampleCertificate -p "$(az keyvault certificate get-default-policy)"
```

You can now reference this certificate that you added to Azure Key Vault by using its URI. Use **`https://<your-unique-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/certificates/ExampleCertificate`** to get the current version. 

To view previously stored certificate:

```azurecli

az keyvault certificate show --name "ExampleCertificate" --vault-name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>"
```

Now, you have created a Key Vault, stored a certificate, and retrieved it.
