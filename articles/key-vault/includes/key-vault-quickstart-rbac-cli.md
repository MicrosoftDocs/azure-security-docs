# Used by articles that show how to assign a Key Vault access policy

---

To grant your user account permissions to your key vault through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), assign a role using the Azure CLI command [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create).

```azurecli
az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Secrets User" --assignee "<your-email-address>" --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<your-unique-keyvault-name>"
```

Replace \<your-email-address\>, \<subscription-id\>, \<resource-group-name\> and \<your-unique-keyvault-name\> with your actual values. \<your-email-address\> is your sign-in name.
