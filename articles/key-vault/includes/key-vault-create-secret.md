Let's create a secret called **mySecret**, with a value of **Success!**. A secret might be a password, a SQL connection string, or any other information that you need to keep both secure and available to your application. 

To add a secret to your newly created key vault, use the following command:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
```azurecli
az keyvault secret set --vault-name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" --name "mySecret" --value "Success!"
```
# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell)

```azurepowershell
$secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'Success!' -AsPlainText
Set-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName <your-unique-keyvault-name> -Name mySecret -SecretValue $secret
```
