# Used by articles that show how to assign a Key Vault access policy

---

To gain permissions to your key vault through [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide.md), assign a role to your "User Principal Name" (UPN) using the Azure PowerShell cmdlet [New-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azroleassignment).

```azurepowershell
New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName "<upn>" -RoleDefinitionName "Key Vault Secrets User" -Scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<your-unique-keyvault-name>"
```

Replace \<upn\>, \<subscription-id\>, \<resource-group-name\> and \<your-unique-keyvault-name\> with your actual values. Your UPN will typically be in the format of an email address (e.g., username@domain.com).
