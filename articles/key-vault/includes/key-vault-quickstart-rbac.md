# Used by articles that show how to assign a Key Vault access policy

---

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To grant your application permissions to your key vault through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), assign a role using the Azure CLI command [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create).

```azurecli
az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Secrets User" --assignee "<app-id>" --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<your-unique-keyvault-name>"
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To grant your application permissions to your key vault through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), assign a role using the Azure PowerShell cmdlet [New-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azroleassignment).

```azurepowershell
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId "<app-id>" -RoleDefinitionName "Key Vault Secrets User" -Scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<your-unique-keyvault-name>"
```

Replace `<app-id>`, `<subscription-id>`, `<resource-group-name>` and `<your-unique-keyvault-name>` with your actual values. `<app-id>` is the Application (client) ID of your registered application in Microsoft Entra.
