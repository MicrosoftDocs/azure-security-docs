# Quickstart: Create a Managed HSM using an ARM template

This quickstart describes how to use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to create an Azure Key Vault managed HSM.  Managed HSM is a fully managed, highly available, single-tenant, standards-compliant cloud service that enables you to safeguards cryptographic keys for your cloud applications, using **FIPS 140-2 Level 3** validated HSMs.  

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the **Deploy to Azure** button. The template will open in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [Azure CLI prepare your environment](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

## Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/managed-hsm-create):

:::code language="json" source="~/quickstart-templates/quickstarts/microsoft.keyvault/managed-hsm-create/azuredeploy.json":::

The Azure resource defined in the template is:

* **Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHSMs**: Create an Azure Key Vault Managed HSM.

## Deploy the template

The template requires the object ID associated with your account. To find it, use the Azure CLI [az ad user show](/cli/azure/ad/user#az-ad-user-show) command, passing your email address to the `--id` parameter. You can limit the output to the object ID only with the `--query` parameter.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad user show --id <your-email-address> --query "objectId"
```

You may also need your tenant ID. To find it, use the Azure CLI [az ad user show](/cli/azure/account#az-account-show) command. You can limit the output to the tenant ID only with the `--query` parameter.

 ```azurecli-interactive
 az account show --query "tenantId"
 ```

You can now deploy the ARM template:

1. Select the following image to sign in to Azure and open a template. The template creates a Managed HSM.

    :::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure-button.svg" alt-text="Button to deploy the Resource Manager template to Azure." border="false" link="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fquickstarts%2Fmicrosoft.keyvault%2Fmanaged-hsm-create%2Fazuredeploy.json":::

1. Select or enter the following values.  Unless specified, use the default value to create the Managed HSM.

    - **Subscription**: Select an Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group**: Select **Create new**, enter "myResourceGroup" as the name, and then select **OK**.
    - **Location**: Select a location. For example, **Norway East**.
    - **managedHSMName**: Enter a name for your Managed HSM.
    - **Tenant ID**: The template function automatically retrieves your tenant ID; don't change the default value.  If there is no value, enter the Tenant ID that you retrieved above.
    - **initialAdminObjectIds**: Enter the Object ID that you retrieved above.

1. Select **Purchase**. After the Managed HSM has been deployed successfully, you get a notification:

The Azure portal is used to deploy the template. In addition to the Azure portal, you can also use the Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and REST API. To learn other deployment methods, see [Deploy templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell).

## Validate the deployment

You can verify that the managed HSM was created with the Azure CLI [az keyvault list](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-list) command. You will find the output easier to read if you format the results as a table:

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault list -o table
```

You should see the name of your newly created managed HSM.

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [Delete resource group](../../../includes/cli-rg-delete.md)]

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting the resource group puts the Managed HSM into a soft-deleted state. The Managed HSM will continue to be billed until it is purged. See [Managed HSM soft-delete and purge protection](recovery.md)

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a Managed HSM. This Managed HSM will not be fully functional until it is activated. See [Activate your Managed HSM](quick-create-cli.md#activate-your-managed-hsm) to learn how to activate your HSM.
