# Quickstart: Create an Azure key vault and a secret using Bicep

[Azure Key Vault](../general/overview.md) is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets, such as keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets. This quickstart focuses on the process of deploying a Bicep file to create a key vault and a secret.

[!INCLUDE [About Bicep](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-bicep-introduction.md)]

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

* Your Microsoft Entra user object ID is needed by the template to configure permissions. The following procedure gets the object ID (GUID).

    1. Run the following Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI command by select **Try it**, and then paste the script into the shell pane. To paste the script, right-click the shell, and then select **Paste**.

        # [CLI](#tab/CLI)
        ```azurecli-interactive
        echo "Enter your email address that is used to sign in to Azure:" &&
        read upn &&
        az ad user show --id $upn --query "objectId" &&
        echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
        ```

        # [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)
        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $upn = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter your email address used to sign in to Azure"
        (Get-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName $upn).Id
        Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue..."
        ```

        ---

    2. Write down the object ID. You need it in the next section of this quickstart.

## Review the Bicep file

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/key-vault-create/).

:::code language="bicep" source="~/quickstart-templates/quickstarts/microsoft.keyvault/key-vault-create/main.bicep":::

Two Azure resources are defined in the Bicep file:

* [**Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults**](/azure/templates/microsoft.keyvault/vaults): create an Azure key vault.
* [**Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets**](/azure/templates/microsoft.keyvault/vaults/secrets): create a key vault secret.

## Deploy the Bicep file

1. Save the Bicep file as **main.bicep** to your local computer.
1. Deploy the Bicep file using either Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

    # [CLI](#tab/CLI)

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name exampleRG --location eastus
    az deployment group create --resource-group exampleRG --template-file main.bicep --parameters keyVaultName=<vault-name> objectId=<object-id>
    ```

    # [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

    ```azurepowershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleRG -Location eastus
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName exampleRG -TemplateFile ./main.bicep -keyVaultName "<vault-name>" -objectId "<object-id>"
    ```

    ---

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace **\<vault-name\>** with the name of the key vault. Replace **\<object-id\>** with the object ID of a user, service principal, or security group in the Microsoft Entra tenant for the vault. The object ID must be unique for the list of access policies. Get it by using Get-AzADUser or Get-AzADServicePrincipal cmdlets.

    When the deployment finishes, you should see a message indicating the deployment succeeded.

## Review deployed resources

You can either use the Azure portal to check the key vault and the secret, or use the following Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell script to list the secret created.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter your key vault name:" &&
read keyVaultName &&
az keyvault secret list --vault-name $keyVaultName &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$keyVaultName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter your key vault name"
Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -vaultName $keyVaultName
Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue..."
```

---

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to delete the resource group and its resources.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name exampleRG
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleRG
```
