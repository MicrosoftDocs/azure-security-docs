# Quickstart: Azure Key Vault secret client library for Python

Get started with the Azure Key Vault secret client library for Python. Follow these steps to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks. By using Key Vault to store secrets, you avoid storing secrets in your code, which increases the security of your app.

[API reference documentation](/python/api/overview/azure/keyvault-secrets-readme) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets) | [Package (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-secrets/)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Python 3.7+](/azure/developer/python/configure-local-development-environment).
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

This quickstart assumes you're running [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) in a Linux terminal window.

## Set up your local environment
This quickstart is using Azure Identity library with Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to authenticate user to Azure Services. Developers can also use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to authenticate their calls, for more information, see [Authenticate the client with Azure Identity client library](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme).

### Sign in to Azure

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Run the `az login` command.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

    If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.

    Otherwise, open a browser page at [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and enter the
    authorization code displayed in your terminal.

2. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Run the `Connect-AzAccount` command.

    ```azurepowershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

    If PowerShell can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.

    Otherwise, open a browser page at [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and enter the
    authorization code displayed in your terminal.

2. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.

### Install the packages

1. In a terminal or command prompt, create a suitable project folder, and then create and activate a Python virtual environment as described on [Use Python virtual environments](/azure/developer/python/configure-local-development-environment#configure-python-virtual-environment).

1. Install the Microsoft Entra identity library:

    ```terminal
    pip install azure-identity
    ```


1. Install the Key Vault secrets library:

    ```terminal
    pip install azure-keyvault-secrets
    ```

### Create a resource group and key vault

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group and key vault](../includes/key-vault-python-qs-rg-kv-creation.md)]

### Set the KEY_VAULT_NAME environmental variable

[!INCLUDE [Set the KEY_VAULT_NAME environmental variable](../includes/key-vault-set-environmental-variables.md)]

### Grant access to your key vault

[!INCLUDE [Using RBAC to provide access to a key vault](../includes/rbac/upn-secrets-officer-cli.md)]

## Create the sample code

The Azure Key Vault secret client library for Python allows you to manage secrets. The following code sample demonstrates how to create a client, set a secret, retrieve a secret, and delete a secret.

Create a file named *kv_secrets.py* that contains this code.

```python
import os
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

keyVaultName = os.environ["KEY_VAULT_NAME"]
KVUri = f"https://{keyVaultName}.vault.azure.net"

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = SecretClient(vault_url=KVUri, credential=credential)

secretName = input("Input a name for your secret > ")
secretValue = input("Input a value for your secret > ")

print(f"Creating a secret in {keyVaultName} called '{secretName}' with the value '{secretValue}' ...")

client.set_secret(secretName, secretValue)

print(" done.")

print(f"Retrieving your secret from {keyVaultName}.")

retrieved_secret = client.get_secret(secretName)

print(f"Your secret is '{retrieved_secret.value}'.")
print(f"Deleting your secret from {keyVaultName} ...")

poller = client.begin_delete_secret(secretName)
deleted_secret = poller.result()

print(" done.")
```

## Run the code

Make sure the code in the previous section is in a file named *kv_secrets.py*. Then run the code with the following command:

```terminal
python kv_secrets.py
```

- If you encounter permissions errors, make sure you ran the [`az keyvault set-policy` or `Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy` command](#grant-access-to-your-key-vault).
- Rerunning the code with the same secret name may produce the error, "(Conflict) Secret \<name\> is currently in a deleted but recoverable state." Use a different secret name.

## Code details

### Authenticate and create a client

Application requests to most Azure services must be authorized. Using the [DefaultAzureCredential](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) class provided by the [Azure Identity client library](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme) is the recommended approach for implementing passwordless connections to Azure services in your code. `DefaultAzureCredential` supports multiple authentication methods and determines which method should be used at runtime. This approach enables your app to use different authentication methods in different environments (local vs. production) without implementing environment-specific code. 

In this quickstart, `DefaultAzureCredential` authenticates to key vault using the credentials of the local development user logged into the Azure CLI. When the application is deployed to Azure, the same `DefaultAzureCredential` code can automatically discover and use a managed identity that is assigned to an App Service, Virtual Machine, or other services. For more information, see [Managed Identity Overview](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

In the example code, the name of your key vault is expanded using the value of the `KVUri` variable, in the format: "https://\<your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net".

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = SecretClient(vault_url=KVUri, credential=credential)
```

### Save a secret

Once you've obtained the client object for the key vault, you can store a secret using the [set_secret](/python/api/azure-keyvault-secrets/azure.keyvault.secrets.secretclient?#azure-keyvault-secrets-secretclient-set-secret) method: 

```python
client.set_secret(secretName, secretValue)
```

Calling `set_secret` generates a call to the Azure REST API for the key vault.

When Azure handles the request, it authenticates the caller's identity (the service principal) using the credential object you provided to the client.

### Retrieve a secret

To read a secret from Key Vault, use the [get_secret](/python/api/azure-keyvault-secrets/azure.keyvault.secrets.secretclient?#azure-keyvault-secrets-secretclient-get-secret) method:

```python
retrieved_secret = client.get_secret(secretName)
 ```

The secret value is contained in `retrieved_secret.value`.

You can also retrieve a secret with the Azure CLI command [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?#az-keyvault-secret-show) or the Azure PowerShell cmdlet [Get-AzKeyVaultSecret](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvaultsecret).

### Delete a secret

To delete a secret, use the [begin_delete_secret](/python/api/azure-keyvault-secrets/azure.keyvault.secrets.secretclient?#azure-keyvault-secrets-secretclient-begin-delete-secret) method:

```python
poller = client.begin_delete_secret(secretName)
deleted_secret = poller.result()
```

The `begin_delete_secret` method is asynchronous and returns a poller object. Calling the poller's `result` method waits for its completion.

You can verify that the secret had been removed with the Azure CLI command [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret?#az-keyvault-secret-show) or the Azure PowerShell cmdlet [Get-AzKeyVaultSecret](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvaultsecret).

Once deleted, a secret remains in a deleted but recoverable state for a time. If you run the code again, use a different secret name.

## Clean up resources

If you want to also experiment with [certificates](../certificates/quick-create-python.md) and [keys](../keys/quick-create-python.md), you can reuse the Key Vault created in this article.

Otherwise, when you're finished with the resources created in this article, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources:

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```
