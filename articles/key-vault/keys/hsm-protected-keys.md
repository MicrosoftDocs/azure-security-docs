# Import HSM-protected keys to Key Vault

For added assurance, when you use Azure Key Vault, you can import or generate keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) that never leave the HSM boundary. This scenario is often referred to as *bring your own key*, or BYOK. Azure Key Vault uses [FIPS 140 validated HSMs](/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys#compliance) to protect your keys.

This functionality is not available for Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../general/overview.md)  
> For a getting started tutorial, which includes creating a key vault for HSM-protected keys, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../general/overview.md).

## Supported HSMs

Transferring HSM-protected keys to Key Vault is supported via two different methods depending on the HSMs you use. Use this table to determine which method should be used for your HSMs to  generate, and then transfer your own HSM-protected keys to use with Azure Key Vault.
