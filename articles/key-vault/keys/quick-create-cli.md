# Quickstart: Set and retrieve a key from Azure Key Vault using Azure CLI

In this quickstart, you create a key vault in Azure Key Vault with Azure CLI. Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that works as a secure secrets store. You can securely store keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets. For more information on Key Vault, review the [Overview](../general/overview.md). Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources using commands or scripts. Once that you've completed that, you will store a key.

 - This quickstart requires version 2.0.4 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

## Create a key vault

[!INCLUDE [Create a key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/key-vault/create-key-vault-cli.md)]

## Give your user account permissions to manage keys in Key Vault

[!INCLUDE [Using RBAC to provide access to a key vault](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/key-vault/rbac/upn-crypto-officer-cli.md)]

## Add a key to Key Vault

To add a key to the vault, you just need to take a couple of additional steps. This key could be used by an application. 

Type this command to create a key called **ExampleKey** :

```azurecli
az keyvault key create --vault-name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" -n ExampleKey --protection software
```

You can now reference this key that you added to Azure Key Vault by using its URI. Use **`https://<your-unique-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/keys/ExampleKey`** to get the current version.

To view previously stored key:

```azurecli

az keyvault key show --name "ExampleKey" --vault-name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>"
```

Now, you've created a Key Vault, stored a key, and retrieved it.
