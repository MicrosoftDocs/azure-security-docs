# Quickstart: Set and retrieve a key from Azure Key Vault using Azure PowerShell

In this quickstart, you create a key vault in Azure Key Vault with Azure PowerShell. Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that works as a secure secrets store. You can securely store keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets. For more information on Key Vault, review the [Overview](../general/overview.md). Azure PowerShell is used to create and manage Azure resources using commands or scripts. Once that you've completed that, you will store a key.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [azure-powershell-requirements-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-powershell/azure-powershell-requirements-no-header.md)]


## Create a resource group

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group](../../../includes/powershell-rg-create.md)]

## Create a key vault

[!INCLUDE [Create a key vault](../includes/key-vault-creation-powershell.md)]

## Give your user account permissions to manage secrets in Key Vault

[!INCLUDE [Using RBAC to provide access to a key vault](../includes/rbac/upn-crypto-officer-powershell.md)]

## Add a key to Key Vault

To add a key to the vault, you just need to take a couple of additional steps. This key could be used by an application. 

Type this command to create a called **ExampleKey** :

```azurepowershell-interactive
Add-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" -Name "ExampleKey" -Destination "Software"
```

You can now reference this key that you added to Azure Key Vault by using its URI. Use **`https://<your-unique-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/keys/ExampleKey`** to get the current version. 

To view previously stored key:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" -KeyName "ExampleKey"
```

Now, you've created a Key Vault, stored a key, and retrieved it.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a Key Vault and stored a certificate in it. To learn more about Key Vault and how to integrate it with your applications, continue on to these articles.
