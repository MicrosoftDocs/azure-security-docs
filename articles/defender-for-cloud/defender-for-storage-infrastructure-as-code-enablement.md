# Enable and configure with Infrastructure as Code templates

We recommend that you enable Defender for Storage on the subscription level. Doing so ensures all storage accounts currently in the subscription will be protected. Storage accounts that are created after enabling Defender for Storage on the subscription level will be protected up to 24 hours after creation.

> [!TIP]
> You can always [configure specific storage accounts](/azure/storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdefender-for-cloud%2Ftoc.json&tabs=enable-subscription#override-defender-for-storage-subscription-level-settings) with custom configurations that differ from the settings configured at the subscription level (override subscription-level settings).

## [Enable on a subscription](#tab/enable-subscription/)

### Terraform template

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage at the subscription level using Terraform, you can use the following code snippet:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing" "DefenderForStorage" {
  tier          = "Standard"
  resource_type = "StorageAccounts"
  subplan       = "DefenderForStorageV2"
 
  extension {
    name = "OnUploadMalwareScanning"
    additional_extension_properties = {
      CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount = "5000"
    }
  }
 
  extension {
    name = "SensitiveDataDiscovery"
  }
}
```

**Modifying the monthly cap for malware scanning**:

To modify the monthly cap for malware scanning per storage account, adjust the `CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount` parameter to your preferred value. This parameter sets a cap on the maximum data that can be scanned for malware each month per storage account. If you want to permit unlimited scanning, assign the value "-1". The default limit is set at 5,000 GB.

**Disabling features**:

If you want to turn off the on-upload malware scanning or sensitive data threat detection features, you can remove the corresponding extension block from the Terraform code.

**Disabling the entire Defender for Storage plan**:

To disable the entire Defender for Storage plan, set the `tier` property value to **"Free"** and remove the `subPlan` and `extension` properties.

Learn more about the `azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing` resource by referring to the [azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/security_center_subscription_pricing). Additionally, you can find comprehensive details on the Terraform provider for Azure in the [Terraform AzureRM Provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs).

### Bicep template

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage at the subscription level using [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep), make sure your [target scope is set to subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deploy-to-subscription?tabs=azure-cli#scope-to-subscription), and add the following to your Bicep template:

```terraform
resource StorageAccounts 'Microsoft.Security/pricings@2023-01-01' = {
  name: 'StorageAccounts'
  properties: {
    pricingTier: 'Standard'
    subPlan: 'DefenderForStorageV2'
    extensions: [
      {
        name: 'OnUploadMalwareScanning'
        isEnabled: 'True'
        additionalExtensionProperties: {
          CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount: '5000'
        }
      }
      {
        name: 'SensitiveDataDiscovery'
        isEnabled: 'True'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Modifying the monthly cap for malware scanning**:

To modify the monthly cap for malware scanning per storage account, adjust the `CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount` parameter to your preferred value. This parameter sets a cap on the maximum data that can be scanned for malware each month per storage account. If you want to permit unlimited scanning, assign the value -1. The default limit is set at 5,000 GB.

**Disabling features**:

If you want to turn off the On-upload malware scanning or Sensitive data threat detection features, you can change the `isEnabled` value to **False** under sensitive data discovery.

**Disabling the entire Defender for Storage plan**:

To disable the entire Defender for Storage plan, set the `pricingTier` property value to **Free** and remove the `subPlan` and `extensions` properties.

Learn more about the [Bicep template in the Microsoft security/pricings documentation](/azure/templates/microsoft.security/pricings?pivots=deployment-language-bicep&source=docs).

### Azure Resource Manager template

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage at the subscription level using an ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template, add this JSON snippet to the resources section of your ARM template:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Security/pricings",
    "apiVersion": "2023-01-01",
    "name": "StorageAccounts",
    "properties": {
        "pricingTier": "Standard",
        "subPlan": "DefenderForStorageV2",
        "extensions": [
            {
                "name": "OnUploadMalwareScanning",
                "isEnabled": "True",
                "additionalExtensionProperties": {
                    "CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount": "5000"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "SensitiveDataDiscovery",
                "isEnabled": "True"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

**Modifying the monthly cap for malware scanning**:

To modify the monthly threshold for malware scanning in your storage accounts, simply adjust the `CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount` parameter to your preferred value. This parameter sets a cap on the maximum data that can be scanned for malware each month, per storage account. If you want to permit unlimited scanning, assign the value -1. The default limit is set at 5,000 GB.

**Disabling features**:

If you want to turn off the on-upload malware scanning or sensitive data threat detection features, you can change the `isEnabled` value to **False** under sensitive data discovery.

**Disabling the entire Defender for Storage plan**:

To disable the entire Defender plan, set the `pricingTier` property value to **Free** and remove the `subPlan` and `extension` properties.

Learn more about the ARM template in the Microsoft.Security/Pricings documentation.

## [Enable on a storage account](#tab/enable-storage-account/)

### Terraform template - storage account

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage at the storage account level using Terraform, import the [AzAPI provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Azure/azapi/latest/docs) and use the following code snippet:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" { ... }

resource "azapi_resource_action" "enable_defender_for_Storage" {
  type        = "Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings@2022-12-01-preview"
  resource_id = "${azurerm_storage_account.example.id}/providers/Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings/current"
  method      = "PUT"

  body = jsonencode({
    properties = {
      isEnabled = true
      malwareScanning = {
        onUpload = {
          isEnabled     = true
          capGBPerMonth = 5000
        }
      }
      sensitiveDataDiscovery = {
        isEnabled = true
      }
      overrideSubscriptionLevelSettings = true
    }
  })
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `azapi_resource_action` used here is an action that is specific to the configuration of Microsoft Defender for Storage. It's different from the typical resource declarations in Terraform, and it's used to perform specific actions on the resource, such as enabling or disabling features.

**Modifying the monthly cap for malware scanning**:

To modify the monthly threshold for malware scanning in your storage accounts, simply adjust the `capGBPerMonth` parameter to your preferred value. This parameter sets a cap on the maximum data that can be scanned for malware each month, per storage account. If you want to permit unlimited scanning, assign the value "-1". The default limit is set at 5,000 GB.

**Disabling features**:

If you want to turn off the on-upload malware scanning or sensitive data threat detection features, you can change the `isEnabled` value to **False** under the `malwareScanning` or `sensitiveDataDiscovery` properties sections.

**Disabling the entire Defender for Storage plan**:

To disable the entire Defender for Storage plan for the storage account, you can use the following code snippet:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" { ... }

resource "azapi_resource_action" "disable_defender_for_Storage" {
  type        = "Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings@2022-12-01-preview"
  resource_id = "${azurerm_storage_account.example.id}/providers/Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings/current"
  method      = "PUT"

  body = jsonencode({
    properties = {
      isEnabled = false
      overrideSubscriptionLevelSettings = false
    }
  })
}
```

You can change the value of `overrideSubscriptionLevelSettings` to **True** to disable Defender for Storage plan for the storage account under subscriptions with Defender for Storage enabled at the subscription level. If you want to keep some features enabled, you can modify the properties accordingly.
Learn more about the [Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings](/rest/api/defenderforcloud/defender-for-storage/create) API documentation for further customization and control over your storage account's security settings. Additionally, you can find comprehensive details on the Terraform provider for Azure in the [Terraform AzureRM Provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs).
