# Compute security recommendations

This article lists all the multicloud compute security recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. 

The recommendations that appear in your environment are based on the resources that you're protecting and on your customized configuration.

To learn about actions that you can take in response to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Defender for Cloud](implement-security-recommendations.md).



> [!TIP]
> If a recommendation description says *No related policy*, usually it's because that recommendation is dependent on a different recommendation.
>
> For example, the recommendation *Endpoint protection health failures should be remediated* relies on the recommendation that checks whether an endpoint protection solution is installed (*Endpoint protection solution should be installed*). The underlying recommendation *does* have a policy.
> Limiting policies to only foundational recommendations simplifies policy management.


## Azure compute recommendations

### [System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Update Center)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/2Ff85bf3e0-d513-442e-89c3-1784ad63382b)

**Description**: Your machines are missing system, security, and critical updates. Software updates often include critical patches to security holes. Such holes are frequently exploited in malware attacks so it's vital to keep your software updated. To install all outstanding patches and secure your machines, follow the remediation steps.

**Severity**: Low

### [Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/2Fbd876905-5b84-4f73-ab2d-2e7a7c4568d9)

**Description**: To ensure periodic assessments for missing system updates are triggered automatically every 24 hours, the AssessmentMode property should be set to 'AutomaticByPlatform'. Learn more about AssessmentMode property for Windows: https://aka.ms/computevm-windowspatchassessmentmode, for Linux: https://aka.ms/computevm-linuxpatchassessmentmode.

**Severity**: Low

### [Adaptive application controls for defining safe applications should be enabled on your machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/35f45c95-27cf-4e52-891f-8390d1de5828)

**Description**: Enable application controls to define the list of known-safe applications running on your machines, and alert you when other applications run. This helps harden your machines against malware. To simplify the process of configuring and maintaining your rules, Defender for Cloud uses machine learning to analyze the applications running on each machine and suggest the list of known-safe applications.
(Related policy: [Adaptive application controls for defining safe applications should be enabled on your machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f47a6b606-51aa-4496-8bb7-64b11cf66adc)).

**Description**: Defender for Cloud collects data from your Azure virtual machines (VMs) to monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats. Data is collected using the [Log Analytics agent](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent), formerly known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA), which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and copies the data to your Log Analytics workspace for analysis. This agent is also required if your VMs are used by an Azure managed service such as Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Service Fabric. We recommend configuring [auto-provisioning](enable-data-collection.md) to automatically deploy the agent. If you choose not to use auto-provisioning, manually deploy the agent to your VMs using the instructions in the remediation steps.

**Description**: This control checks whether the compliance status of the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager patch compliance is COMPLIANT or NON_COMPLIANT after the patch installation on the instance.
It only checks instances managed by AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager.
It doesn't check whether the patch was applied within the 30-day limit prescribed by PCI DSS requirement '6.2'.
It also doesn't validate whether the patches applied were classified as security patches.
You should create patching groups with the appropriate baseline settings and ensure in-scope systems are managed by those patch groups in Systems Manager.

*"[Encrypted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/API_DescribeFileSystems.html)" is set to "false" in the DescribeFileSystems response.
 The "[KmsKeyId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/API_DescribeFileSystems.html)" key in the [DescribeFileSystems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/API_DescribeFileSystems.html) response doesn't match the KmsKeyId parameter for [efs-encrypted-check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/efs-encrypted-check.html).
 Note that this control doesn't use the "KmsKeyId" parameter for [efs-encrypted-check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/efs-encrypted-check.html). It only checks the value of "Encrypted". For an added layer of security for your sensitive data in Amazon EFS, you should create encrypted file systems.
 Amazon EFS supports encryption for file systems at-rest. You can enable encryption of data at rest when you create an Amazon EFS file system.

**Description**: This control checks whether an Amazon CloudFront distribution is configured with an origin group that has two or more origins.
CloudFront origin failover can increase availability. Origin failover automatically redirects traffic to a secondary origin if the primary origin is unavailable or if it returns specific HTTP response status codes.

**Severity**: Medium

### [CodeBuild GitHub or Bitbucket source repository URLs should use OAuth](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/9694d4ef-f21a-40b7-b535-618ac5c5d21e)

**Description**: This control checks whether the GitHub or Bitbucket source repository URL contains either personal access tokens or a user name and password.
Authentication credentials should never be stored or transmitted in clear text or appear in the repository URL. Instead of personal access tokens or user name and password, you should use OAuth to grant authorization for accessing GitHub or Bitbucket repositories.
 Using personal access tokens or a user name and password could expose your credentials to unintended data exposure and unauthorized access.

**Severity**: High

### [CodeBuild project environment variables should not contain credentials](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/a88b4b72-b461-4b5e-b024-91da1cbe500f)

**Description**: This control checks whether the project contains the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
Authentication credentials `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` should never be stored in clear text, as this could lead to unintended data exposure and unauthorized access.

### [DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) clusters should be encrypted at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/58e67d3d-8b17-4c1c-9bc4-550b10f0328a)

**Description**: This control checks whether a DAX cluster is encrypted at rest.
 Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data stored on disk being accessed by a user not authenticated to AWS. The encryption adds another set of access controls to limit the ability of unauthorized users to access to the data.
 For example, API permissions are required to decrypt the data before it can be read.

**Severity**: Medium

### [DynamoDB tables should automatically scale capacity with demand](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/47476790-2527-4bdb-b839-3b48ed18dccf)

**Description**: This control checks whether an Amazon DynamoDB table can scale its read and write capacity as needed. This control passes if the table uses either on-demand capacity mode or provisioned mode with auto scaling configured.
 Scaling capacity with demand avoids throttling exceptions, which helps to maintain availability of your applications.

**Severity**: Medium

### [Instances managed by Systems Manager should have an association compliance status of COMPLIANT](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/67a90ae0-b3d1-44f0-9dcf-a03234ebeb65)

**Description**: This control checks whether the status of the AWS Systems Manager association compliance is COMPLIANT or NON_COMPLIANT after the association is run on an instance. The control passes if the association compliance status is COMPLIANT.
A State Manager association is a configuration that is assigned to your managed instances. The configuration defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances. For example, an association can specify that antivirus software must be installed and running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed.
After you create one or more State Manager associations, compliance status information is immediately available to you in the console or in response to AWS CLI commands or corresponding Systems Manager API operations. For associations, "Configuration" Compliance shows statuses of Compliant or Non-compliant and the severity level assigned to the association, such as *Critical* or *Medium*. To learn more about State Manager association compliance, see [About State Manager association compliance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-compliance-about.html#sysman-compliance-about-association) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
You must configure your in-scope EC2 instances for Systems Manager association. You must also configure the patch baseline for the security rating of the vendor of patches, and set the autoapproval date to meet PCI DSS *3.2.1* requirement *6.2*. For more guidance on how to [Create an association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-state-assoc.html), see Create an association in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

### [Lambda functions should have a dead-letter queue configured](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/dcf10b98-798f-4734-9afd-800916bf1e65)

**Description**: This control checks whether a Lambda function is configured with a dead-letter queue. The control fails if the Lambda function isn't configured with a dead-letter queue.
As an alternative to an on-failure destination, you can configure your function with a dead-letter queue to save discarded events for further processing.
 A dead-letter queue acts the same as an on-failure destination. It's used when an event fails all processing attempts or expires without being processed.
A dead-letter queue allows you to look back at errors or failed requests to your Lambda function to debug or identify unusual behavior.
From a security perspective, it's important to understand why your function failed and to ensure that your function doesn't drop data or compromise data security as a result.
 For example, if your function can't communicate to an underlying resource, that could be a symptom of a denial of service (DoS) attack elsewhere in the network.

**Severity**: Medium

### [Lambda functions should use supported runtimes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/e656e5b7-130c-4fb4-be90-9bdd4f82fdfb)

**Description**: This control checks that the Lambda function settings for runtimes match the expected values set for the supported runtimes for each language. This control checks for the following runtimes:
 **nodejs14.x**, **nodejs12.x**, **nodejs10.x**, **python3.8**, **python3.7**, **python3.6**, **ruby2.7**, **ruby2.5**, **java11**, **java8**, **java8.al2**, **go1.x**, **dotnetcore3.1**, **dotnetcore2.1**
[Lambda runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) are built around a combination of operating system, programming language, and software libraries that are subject to maintenance and security updates. When a runtime component is no longer supported for security updates, Lambda deprecates the runtime. Even though you can't create functions that use the deprecated runtime, the function is still available to process invocation events. Make sure that your Lambda functions are current and don't use out-of-date runtime environments.
To learn more about the supported runtimes that this control checks for the supported languages, see [AWS Lambda runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.

### [Ensure 'Block Project-wide SSH keys' is enabled for VM instances](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/00f8a6a6-cf69-4c11-822e-3ebf4910e545)

**Description**: It's recommended to use Instance specific SSH key(s) instead of using common/shared project-wide SSH key(s) to access Instances.
Project-wide SSH keys are stored in Compute/Project-meta-data. Project wide SSH keys can be used to log in into all the instances within project. Using project-wide SSH keys eases the SSH key management but if compromised, poses the security risk that can affect all the instances within project.
 It's recommended to use Instance specific SSH keys that can limit the attack surface if the SSH keys are compromised.

**Severity**: Medium

### [Ensure Compute instances are launched with Shielded VM enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1a4b3b3a-7de9-4aa4-a29b-580d59b43f79)

**Description**: To defend against advanced threats and ensure that the boot loader and firmware on your VMs are signed and untampered, it's recommended that Compute instances are launched with Shielded VM enabled.
Shielded VMs are VMs on Google Cloud Platform hardened by a set of security controls that help defend against ```rootkits``` and ```bootkits```.
Shielded VM offers verifiable integrity of your Compute Engine VM instances, so you can be confident your instances haven't been compromised by boot- or kernel-level malware or rootkits.
Shielded VM's verifiable integrity is achieved through the use of Secure Boot, virtual trusted platform module (vTPM)-enabled Measured Boot, and integrity monitoring.
Shielded VM instances run firmware that is signed and verified using Google's Certificate Authority, ensuring that the instance's firmware is unmodified and establishing the root of trust for Secure Boot.
Integrity monitoring helps you understand and make decisions about the state of your VM instances and the Shielded VM vTPM enables Measured Boot by performing the measurements needed to create a known good boot baseline, called the integrity policy baseline.
The integrity policy baseline is used for comparison with measurements from subsequent VM boots to determine if anything has changed.
Secure Boot helps ensure that the system only runs authentic software by verifying the digital signature of all boot components, and halting the boot process if signature verification fails.

**Severity**: High

### [Ensure 'Enable connecting to serial ports' is not enabled for VM Instance](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/7e060336-2c9e-4289-a2a6-8d301bad47bb)

**Description**: Interacting with a serial port is often referred to as the serial console, which is similar to using a terminal window, in that input and output is entirely in text mode and there's no graphical interface or mouse support.
If you enable the interactive serial console on an instance, clients can attempt to connect to that instance from any IP address. Therefore interactive serial console support should be disabled.
A virtual machine instance has four virtual serial ports. Interacting with a serial port is similar to using a terminal window, in that input and output is entirely in text mode and there's no graphical interface or mouse support.
The instance's operating system, BIOS, and other system-level entities often write output to the serial ports, and can accept input such as commands or answers to prompts.
Typically, these system-level entities use the first serial port (port 1) and serial port 1 is often referred to as the serial console.
The interactive serial console doesn't support IP-based access restrictions such as IP allowlists. If you enable the interactive serial console on an instance, clients can attempt to connect to that instance from any IP address.
This allows anybody to connect to that instance if they know the correct SSH key, username, project ID, zone, and instance name.
Therefore interactive serial console support should be disabled.

**Severity**: Medium

### [Ensure 'log_duration' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/272820a7-06ce-44b3-8318-4ec1f82237dc)

**Description**: Enabling the log_hostname setting causes the duration of each completed statement to be logged.
 This doesn't logs the text of the query and thus behaves different from the log_min_duration_statement flag.
 This parameter can't be changed after session start.
 Monitoring the time taken to execute the queries can be crucial in identifying any resource hogging queries and assessing the performance of the server.
 Further steps such as load balancing and use of optimized queries can be taken to ensure the performance and stability of the server.
 This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

**Severity**: Low

### [Ensure 'log_executor_stats' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'off'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/19711549-76eb-4f1f-b43b-b1048e66c1f0)

**Description**: The PostgreSQL executor is responsible to execute the plan handed over by the PostgreSQL planner.
 The executor processes the plan recursively to extract the required set of rows.
 The "log_executor_stats" flag controls the inclusion of PostgreSQL executor performance statistics in the PostgreSQL logs for each query.
 The "log_executor_stats" flag enables a crude profiling method for logging PostgreSQL executor performance statistics, which even though can be useful for troubleshooting, it might increase the number of logs significantly and have performance overhead.
 This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

**Severity**: Low

### [Ensure 'log_min_error_statement' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'Error' or stricter](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/50a1058e-925b-4998-9d93-5eaa8f7021a3)

**Description**: The "log_min_error_statement" flag defines the minimum message severity level that is considered as an error statement.
 Messages for error statements are logged with the SQL statement.
 Valid values include "DEBUG5," "DEBUG4," "DEBUG3," "DEBUG2," "DEBUG1," "INFO," "NOTICE," "WARNING," "ERROR," "LOG," "FATAL," and "PANIC."
 Each severity level includes the subsequent levels mentioned above.
 Ensure a value of ERROR or stricter is set.
 Auditing helps in troubleshooting operational problems and also permits forensic analysis.
 If "log_min_error_statement" isn't set to the correct value, messages might not be classified as error messages appropriately.
 Considering general log messages as error messages would make is difficult to find actual errors and considering only stricter severity levels as error messages might skip actual errors to log their SQL statements.
 The "log_min_error_statement" flag should be set to "ERROR" or stricter.
 This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

**Severity**: Low

### [Ensure 'log_parser_stats' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'off'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/a6efc275-b1c1-4003-8e85-2f30b2eb56e6)

**Description**: The PostgreSQL planner/optimizer is responsible to parse and verify the syntax of each query received by the server.
 If the syntax is correct a "parse tree" is built up else an error is generated.
 The "log_parser_stats" flag controls the inclusion of parser performance statistics in the PostgreSQL logs for each query.
 The "log_parser_stats" flag enables a crude profiling method for logging parser performance statistics, which even though can be useful for troubleshooting, it might increase the number of logs significantly and have performance overhead.
 This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

**Description**: Compute instances shouldn't be configured to have external IP addresses.
To reduce your attack surface, Compute instances shouldn't have public IP addresses. Instead, instances should be configured behind load balancers, to minimize the instance's exposure to the internet.
Instances created by GKE should be excluded because some of them have external IP addresses and can't be changed by editing the instance settings.
These VMs have names that start with ```gke-``` and are labeled ```goog-gke-node```.

**Severity**: High

### [Ensure that instances are not configured to use the default service account](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/a107c44c-75e4-4607-b1b0-cd5cfcf249e0)

**Description**: It's recommended to configure your instance to not use the default Compute Engine service account because it has the Editor role on the project.
The default Compute Engine service account has the Editor role on the project, which allows read and write access to most Google Cloud Services.
To defend against privilege escalations if your VM is compromised, and to prevent an attacker from gaining access to all of your projects, it's recommended to not use the default Compute Engine service account.
Instead, you should create a new service account and assigning only the permissions needed by your instance.
The default Compute Engine service account is named `[PROJECT_NUMBER]- compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`.
VMs created by GKE should be excluded. These VMs have names that start with ```gke-``` and are labeled ```goog-gke-node```.

**Severity**: High

### [Ensure that instances are not configured to use the default service account with full access to all Cloud APIs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/a8c1fcf1-ca66-4fc1-b5e6-51d7f4f76782)

**Description**: To support principle of least privileges and prevent potential privilege escalation, it's recommended that instances aren't assigned to default service account "Compute Engine default service account" with Scope "Allow full access to all Cloud APIs."
Along with ability to optionally create, manage, and use user managed custom service accounts, Google Compute Engine provides default service account "Compute Engine default service account" for an instance to access necessary cloud services.

"Project Editor" role is assigned to "Compute Engine default service account" hence, This service account has almost all capabilities over all cloud services except billing.
However, when "Compute Engine default service account" assigned to an instance it can operate in three scopes.

- Allow default access: Allows only minimum access required to run an Instance (Least Privileges).
- Allow full access to all Cloud APIs: Allow full access to all the cloud APIs/Services (Too much access).
- Set access for each API: Allows Instance administrator to choose only those APIs that are needed to perform specific business functionality expected by instance.

When an instance is configured with "Compute Engine default service account" with Scope "Allow full access to all Cloud APIs," based on IAM roles assigned to the user(s) accessing Instance,
it might allow user to perform cloud operations/API calls that user isn't supposed to perform leading to successful privilege escalation.

VMs created by GKE should be excluded. These VMs have names that start with ```gke-``` and are labeled ```goog-gke-node```.

**Severity**: Medium

### [Ensure that IP forwarding is not enabled on Instances](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/0ba588a6-4539-4e67-bc62-d7b2b51300fb)

**Description**: Compute Engine instance can't forward a packet unless the source IP address of the packet matches the IP address of the instance. Similarly, GCP won't deliver a packet whose destination IP address is different than the IP address of the instance receiving the packet.
 However, both capabilities are required if you want to use instances to help route packets.
Forwarding of data packets should be disabled to prevent data loss or information disclosure.
Compute Engine instance can't forward a packet unless the source IP address of the packet matches the IP address of the instance. Similarly, GCP won't deliver a packet whose destination IP address is different than the IP address of the instance receiving the packet.
 However, both capabilities are required if you want to use instances to help route packets. To enable this source and destination IP check, disable the canIpForward field, which allows an instance to send and receive packets with nonmatching destination or source IPs.

### [Ensure that the 'log_checkpoints' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/a2404629-0132-4ab3-839e-8389dbe9fe98)

**Description**: Ensure that the log_checkpoints database flag for the Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to on.
Enabling log_checkpoints causes checkpoints and restart points to be logged in the server log. Some statistics are included in the log messages, including the number of buffers written and the time spent writing them.
 This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

### [Ensure that the 'log_lock_waits' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/8191f530-fde7-4177-827a-43ce0f69ffe7)

**Description**: Enabling the "log_lock_waits" flag for a PostgreSQL instance creates a log for any session waits that take longer than the allotted "deadlock_timeout" time to acquire a lock.
 The deadlock timeout defines the time to wait on a lock before checking for any conditions. Frequent run overs on deadlock timeout can be an indication of an underlying issue.
 Logging such waits on locks by enabling the log_lock_waits flag can be used to identify poor performance due to locking delays or if a specially crafted SQL is attempting to starve resources through holding locks for excessive amounts of time.
 This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

**Severity**: Low

### [Ensure that the 'log_min_duration_statement' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to '-1'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1c9e237b-419f-4e73-b43a-94b5863dd73e)

**Description**: The "log_min_duration_statement" flag defines the minimum amount of execution time of a statement in milliseconds where the total duration of the statement is logged. Ensure that "log_min_duration_statement" is disabled, that is, a value of -1 is set.
 Logging SQL statements might include sensitive information that shouldn't be recorded in logs. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

**Severity**: Low

### [Ensure that the 'log_min_messages' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set appropriately](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/492fed4e-1871-4c12-948d-074ee0f07559)

**Description**: The "log_min_error_statement" flag defines the minimum message severity level that is considered as an error statement.
 Messages for error statements are logged with the SQL statement.
 Valid values include "DEBUG5," "DEBUG4," "DEBUG3," "DEBUG2," "DEBUG1," "INFO," "NOTICE," "WARNING," "ERROR," "LOG," "FATAL," and "PANIC."
 Each severity level includes the subsequent levels mentioned above.
 To effectively turn off logging failing statements, set this parameter to PANIC.
 ERROR is considered the best practice setting. Changes should only be made in accordance with the organization's logging policy.
Auditing helps in troubleshooting operational problems and also permits forensic analysis.
 If "log_min_error_statement" isn't set to the correct value, messages might not be classified as error messages appropriately.
 Considering general log messages as error messages would make it difficult to find actual errors, while considering only stricter severity levels as error messages might skip actual errors to log their SQL statements.
 The "log_min_error_statement" flag should be set in accordance with the organization's logging policy.
 This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

### [Ensure that the 'log_temp_files' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to '0'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/29622fc0-14dc-4d65-a5a8-e9a39ffc4b62)

**Description**: PostgreSQL can create a temporary file for actions such as sorting, hashing, and temporary query results when these operations exceed "work_mem."
 The "log_temp_files" flag controls logging names and the file size when it's deleted.
 Configuring "log_temp_files" to 0 causes all temporary file information to be logged, while positive values log only files whose size is greater than or equal to the specified number of kilobytes.
 A value of "-1" disables temporary file information logging.
 If all temporary files aren't logged, it might be more difficult to identify potential performance issues that might be due to either poor application coding or deliberate resource starvation attempts.

**Severity**: Low

### [Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/6ca40f30-2508-4c90-85b6-36564b909364)

**Description**: Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) are a feature in Google Cloud Storage and Google Compute Engine.
 If you supply your own encryption keys, Google uses your key to protect the Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data.
 By default, Google Compute Engine encrypts all data at rest.
 Compute Engine handles and manages this encryption for you without any additional actions on your part.
 However, if you wanted to control and manage this encryption yourself, you can provide your own encryption keys.
By default, Google Compute Engine encrypts all data at rest. Compute Engine handles and manages this encryption for you without any additional actions on your part.
However, if you wanted to control and manage this encryption yourself, you can provide your own encryption keys.
If you provide your own encryption keys, Compute Engine uses your key to protect the Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data.
Only users who can provide the correct key can use resources protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.
Google doesn't store your keys on its servers and can't access your protected data unless you provide the key.
This also means that if you forget or lose your key, there's no way for Google to recover the key or to recover any data encrypted with the lost key.
At least business critical VMs should have VM disks encrypted with CSEK.
