# Overview of integration with Power BI

Microsoft Defender for Cloud has the ability to integrate its information into Microsoft Power BI to enhance the value derived from Defender for Cloud's data. 

Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. By integrating the information collected by Defender for Cloud 
you can monitor, analyze, and respond to security issues effectively. 

Defender for Cloud's [Azure Monitor Workbooks](custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks.md) provide valuable visualizations for Defender for Cloud's data, but integrating Power BI offers an enhanced approach to data analysis and visualization. Power BI's advanced features, such as customizable dashboards, interactive elements, and seamless integration with various data sources.

## Benefits of integrating Power BI with Defender for Cloud

Power BI’s extensive array of visualization options allows you to create highly customized and visually compelling dashboards. These dashboards enable effective communication of insights to various stakeholders, ensuring that critical information is easily understood and actionable. Power BI’s robust analytical tools, including Data Analysis Expressions and AI capabilities, which allow you to perform complex data analyses and uncover deeper insights that can drive better decision-making.

Another significant benefit of this integration is the seamless data consolidation and collaborative features offered by Power BI. The platform's ability to integrate with various data sources, including Azure Resource Graph, means security teams can consolidate data from multiple platforms into a single, unified view. This unified view simplifies monitoring and analysis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the security landscape. Additionally, Power BI facilitates collaboration by enabling you to share dashboards and reports with ease, while role-based access controls ensure that sensitive data remains secure. With its intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, Power BI is user-friendly and accessible, making it easier for individuals of all skill levels to create and customize visualizations, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations.

When you integrate Power BI with Defender for Cloud, you can bypass the 1,000-record limit in Azure Resource Graph, enabling comprehensive data retrieval. This integration ensures access to complete datasets, leading to better insights and more informed decision-making. It improves efficiency in managing large volumes of data and enhances security management by providing deeper visibility into your security posture.
