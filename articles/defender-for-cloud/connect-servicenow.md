# Connect ServiceNow ITSM to Defender for Cloud

You can connect Microsoft Defender for Cloud with [ServiceNowâ€™s IT Service Management (ITSM)](integration-servicenow.md##it-service-management-itsm) module to improve incident management and remediation. The integration lets you create and track ServiceNow tickets that are linked to Defender for Cloud security recommendations, helping your teams respond efficiently to issues across Azure, hybrid, and multicloud environments.
