# Code reachability analysis

**Episode description**: In this episode of Defender for Cloud in the Field, Lara Goldstein joins Yuri Diogenes to talk about code reachability analysis in Defender for Cloud. Lara explains why reachability analysis for vulnerabilities is important, what it means for a vulnerability to be reachable, and how Defender for Cloud can help with this type of scenario. Lara demonstrates how Defender for Cloud leverages these insights to build an attack path and how you can use Cloud Security Explorer to obtain more information about this type of scenario.
