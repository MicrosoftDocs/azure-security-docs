# Containers software supply chain (CSSC) security using Defender for Containers

In today's cloud-native environments, securing the container software supply chain is crucial to protect applications from vulnerabilities and threats. Microsoft Defender for Containers collaborates within the [Microsoft CSSC framework](/security/container-secure-supply-chain.md) to provide comprehensive security capabilities to safeguard your containerized applications throughout their lifecycle. From development to deployment, Defender for Containers helps you identify and mitigate risks, ensuring that your container images and runtime environments are secure.

With Defender for Containers, you can:
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Sign the container image and its vulnerability report to ensure vulnerabilities were not introduced within your organization's CSSC.
- Create policies to control deployment of container images based on vulnerabilities detected in the container image.
- Monitor runtime behavior to detect and respond to threats.
- Enforce security policies to maintain compliance.
- Gain visibility into your container security posture.

By integrating Defender for Containers into your DevOps processes, you can enhance the security of your container software supply chain and build resilient, secure applications.
