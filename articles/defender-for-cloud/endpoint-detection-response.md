# Remediate EDR solutions (agentless)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud integrates natively with [Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint) to provide endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities for machines connected to Defender for Cloud. 

As part of these [integrated EDR capabilities](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md), Defender for Cloud agentlessly scans machines to assess whether they're running an EDR solution×¥ The solution can be integrated Defender for Endpoint EDR, or a [supported third-party solution](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#supported-edr-solutions).


Based on EDR solution findings, Defender for Cloud provides [recommendations](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#edr-solution-recommendations) to ensure that EDR solutions are installed and running correctly on VMs.

This article describes how to remediate those recommendations.

> [!NOTE]
> - Defender for Cloud uses agentless scanning to assess EDR settings.
> - Agentless scanning replaces the Log Analytics agent (also known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)), which was previously used to collect machine data.
> - The MMA is set to retire. Scanning using the MMA will be deprecated in November 2024. 

## Prerequisites

EDR solution recommendations are available when:

- [Defender for Cloud](connect-azure-subscription.md) is available in the Azure subscription.
- One of these Defender for Cloud plans is enabled:
  - [Defender for Servers Plan 2](tutorial-enable-servers-plan.md)
  - [Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](tutorial-enable-cspm-plan.md)
- [Agentless scanning for machines](concept-agentless-data-collection.md) is turned on. It's enabled by default in the plans, but if you need to turn it on manually, [follow these instructions](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md).


## Investigate EDR solution recommendations
.

1. In  **Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Search for and select one of the following recommendations:

    - `EDR solution should be installed on Virtual Machines`
    - `EDR solution should be installed on EC2s`
    - `EDR solution should be installed on Virtual Machines (GCP)`

1. In the recommendation details, select the **Healthy resources** tab.

1. The EDR solution deployed on the machine is displayed in the **Discovered EDRs** column.

## Remediate EDR solution recommendations

1. Select the relevant recommendation.

    :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-detection-response/identify-recommendations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the recommendations page showing the identified endpoint solution recommendations." lightbox="media/endpoint-detection-response/identify-recommendations.png":::

1. Select the relevant action to see the remediation steps.


## Enable Defender for Endpoint integration

This recommended action is available when Defender for Endpoint, or an [supported third-party EDR solution](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#supported-edr-solutions) wasn't detected on the VM.


To enable Defender for Endpoint on the machine: 

1. Select the affected machine. You can also select multiple machines with the `Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration` recommended action.

1. Select **Fix**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-detection-response/enable-fix.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where the fix button is located." lightbox="media/endpoint-detection-response/enable-fix.png":::

1. In **Enable EDR solution**, select **Enable**. With this setting enabled, the Defender for Endpoint sensor is automatically installed on all Windows and Linux servers in the subscription.

    After the process is completed, it can take up to 24 hours until your machine appears in the **Healthy resources** tab.

### Upgrade Defender plan

This recommended action is available when:

- One of the [supported third-party EDR solutions](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#supported-edr-solutions) wasn't detected on the VM.
- One of the supported plans (Defender for Servers Plan 2 or Defender CSPM) isn't enabled for the VM.

To fix the recommendation.

1. Select the affected machine. You can also select multiple machines with the `Upgrade Defender plan` recommended action.

1. Select **Fix**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-detection-response/upgrade-fix.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where the fix button is located on the screen." lightbox="media/endpoint-detection-response/upgrade-fix.png":::

1. In **Enable EDR solution**, select a plan in the dropdown menu. Each plan comes with a cost.[Learn more about pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).

1. Select **Enable**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-detection-response/enable-plan.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the pop-up window that allows you to select which Defender for Servers plan to enable on your subscription.":::

After the process is completed, it can take up to 24 hours until your machine appears on the **Healthy resources** tab.

### Troubleshoot issues

This recommended action is available when Defender for Endpoint is detected on a machine but wasn't onboarded properly.


1. Select the affected VM.

1. Select **Remediation steps**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/endpoint-detection-response/remediation-steps.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where the remediation steps are located in the recommendation." lightbox="media/endpoint-detection-response/remediation-steps.png":::

1. Follow the instructions to troubleshoot onboarding issues for [Windows](/defender-endpoint/troubleshoot-onboarding) or [Linux](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux).

After the process is completed, it can take up to 24 hours until your machine appears in the Healthy resources tab.
