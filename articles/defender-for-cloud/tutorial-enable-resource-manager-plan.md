# Protect your resources with Defender for Resource Manager

[Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) is the deployment and management service for Azure.

Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager automatically monitors the resource management operations in your organization, whether they're performed through the Azure portal, Azure REST APIs, Azure CLI, or other Azure programmatic clients. Defender for Cloud runs advanced security analytics to detect threats and alerts you about suspicious activity.
