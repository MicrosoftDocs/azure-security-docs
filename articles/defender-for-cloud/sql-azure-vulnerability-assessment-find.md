# Review and remediate SQL vulnerability assessment findings

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides [SQL Vulnerability Assessment](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md) for your Azure SQL databases. SQL Vulnerability Assessment scans your databases for software vulnerabilities and provides a list of findings. Scan cycles help maintain a high level of security and ensure compliance with organizational security policies.

Use Vulnerability Assessment findings to fix software vulnerabilities and mark findings as baseline. You can run an on-demand Vulnerability Assessment scan to refresh and review the latest findings.

SQL Vulnerability Assessment is available in two configurations: **express** and **classic**. Both configurations use the same remediation workflow and baseline management. The only difference is the baseline approval timing. 

## Prerequisites

- SQL Vulnerability Assessment is enabled on your Azure SQL resource.

- Review the required permissions and the data residency conditions:
    - [Express configuration](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md#express-configuration)
    - [Classic configuration](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md#classic-configuration)

- The baseline approval timing differs by configuration model.
 If you aren't sure which Vulnerability Assessment configuration you are using, use the following steps to check:
    1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
    1. Open your SQL Database resource.
    1. Under the **Security** heading, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
    1. In the **Enablement Status**, select **Configure** to open the Microsoft Defender for SQL settings pane for either the entire server or managed instance.

  If the vulnerability settings show the option to configure a storage account, you're using the classic configuration. If not, you're using the express configuration.

## Run an on-demand scan

Run a read-only, on-demand Vulnerability Assessment scan to refresh findings instead of waiting for the next scheduled scan.

To run an on-demand scan:

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Open your SQL Database resource.

1. Under the **Security** heading, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. Select **View additional findings in Vulnerability Assessment**.

1. Select **Scan**.

1. [Review and remediate vulnerabilities](#review-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings).

## Review and remediate Vulnerability Assessment findings

After a scan completes, the **Vulnerability Assessment** page shows a full view of your database security. This includes:

- An overview of your security state
- The number of issues found
- A severity summary of risks
- A list of findings for investigation

# [Database-level recommendations experience](#tab/database-level)

> [!NOTE]
> This experience is currently in preview. The existing server-level (aggregated) experience remains available during preview.

In this experience:

- SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings follow the same recommendation structure used across Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Each SQL Vulnerability Assessment rule corresponds to its own recommendation.
- Recommendations are associated directly with the affected SQL database resource.
- Each rule can be reviewed, remediated, or marked as baseline independently.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to **Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Select the **Recommendations by risk** view.

1. Adjust the view: 
    - Use the **View per resource** filter to list all instances of the assessment by reported resource.

    - Use the **View by title** filter to aggregate all instances of the assessment under one value.

1. Select the **Scanner** filter and from the options, select **SQL Vulnerability Assessment**.

1. Review findings (**View by resource** only):

   1. Select a recommendation.
   1. Review its description.
   1. Select **Manage query results and remediation** to review the query used for evaluating the recommendation, generate a remediation script, or set a baseline.
   1. Select the resource name link for more information and actions.

   1. In the database’s **Resource health** page, review the recommendations generated for the resource, trigger a SQL VA scan, or go to the SQL VA scan history page.

1. Review findings (**View by title** only): 

   1. Select a recommendation.
   1. Select **View remediation scripts** for an aggregated view of the types of remediation operations for all databases in scope.
   1. After reviewing, close the **Remediation scripts** side pane.
   1. Scroll to the right to reach the **Actions** column under **Affected resources**. 
   1. Select **Show query and results** for each affected database to set up baselines at scale.
  
1. Verify that the remmediated findings appear as healthy. In the express configuration, baseline approval takes effect immediately. In the classic configuration, baseline approval takes effect the next scan.

# [Server-level (aggregated) experience](#tab/server-level)

In the server-level experience, SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings are shown as subassessments directly in the SQL Database resource.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Troubleshoot common issues

Use this table to resolve common issues when working with SQL Vulnerability Assessment:

| Issue | Likely cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Scan results not visible | Missing viewer role | Ensure Security Admin or Security Reader role is assigned. |
| Can't change settings | Insufficient configuration role | Assign SQL Security Manager (and for classic: Owner + Storage Blob Data Reader on storage account). |
| Baseline not reflected (classic) | New scan not run yet | Run another on-demand scan to apply baseline changes. |
| Baseline not reflected (express) | Expectation mismatch | Baseline applies immediately; refresh the Vulnerability Assessment tab. |
| Access error opening email link (classic) | Storage role missing | Add Storage Blob Data Reader for the storage account containing scan results. |
