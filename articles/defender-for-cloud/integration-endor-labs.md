# Overview of Endor Labs integration

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's integration with Endor Labs enhances the existing vulnerability analysis security capabilities that are provided by Defender for Cloud for comprehensive code to runtime visibility of critical vulnerabilities.

Partner integrations with Defender for Cloud provide a seamless experience for customers to enhance their security posture by leveraging the capabilities of partner solutions. Integrating partner solutions helps to further streamline, integrate, and orchestrate security findings with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to effectively discover and remediate reachable vulnerabilities before they reach production.

Reachable vulnerabilities are security flaws in partner dependencies that have a direct and exploitable execution path. These vulnerabilities are high risk because they can be actively triggered within the application's current flow and exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these vulnerabilities is critical in the prevention of potential attacks.

## Benefits of integrating Endor Labs

Endor Labs is a security platform that focuses on the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities in partner dependencies within software applications. Endor Labs offers advanced reachability analysis that assess the execution paths of these vulnerabilities, allowing security teams to prioritize and address them effectively.

By integrating Endor Labs with Microsoft Defender for Cloud gives you gain the following benefits:

- Streamline the discovery and remediation of reachable vulnerabilities. 
- A comprehensive view of security risks within an application's code flow. 
- Assist in the prevention of potential attacks through the identification of high-risk vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, thus ensuring robust application security from code to runtime.

With the integration, reachability analysis findings from Endor Labs are accessible within Defender for Cloud. This provides visibility into the health of the code for central security teams, enabling them to better prioritize and mitigate open-source vulnerabilities from code development to runtime through advanced function-level reachability analysis.
