# Overview of Endor Labs integration

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's integration with Endor Labs improves its vulnerability analysis, giving a complete view of critical vulnerabilities from code to runtime.

Partner integrations with Defender for Cloud provide a seamless experience for customers to enhance their security posture by applying the capabilities of partner solutions. Integrating partner solutions with Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps to easily find and fix vulnerabilities before they reach production.

Reachable vulnerabilities are security flaws in partner dependencies that have a direct and exploitable execution path. These vulnerabilities are high risk because they can be actively triggered within the application's current flow and exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these vulnerabilities is critical in the prevention of potential attacks.

## Benefits of integrating Endor Labs

Endor Labs is a security platform that focuses on the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities in partner dependencies within software applications. Endor Labs offers advanced reachability analysis that assesses the execution paths of these vulnerabilities, allowing security teams to prioritize and address them effectively.

Integrating Endor Labs with Microsoft Defender for Cloud gives you gain the ability to:

- Streamline the discovery and remediation of reachable vulnerabilities.
- View a comprehensive view list of security risks within an application's code flow.
- Help with the prevention of potential attacks through the identification of high-risk vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, thus ensuring robust application security from code to runtime.

With the integration, reachability analysis findings from Endor Labs are accessible within Defender for Cloud. The integration provides visibility into the health of the code for central security teams, enabling them to better prioritize and mitigate open-source vulnerabilities from code development to runtime through advanced function-level reachability analysis.
