      - question: |
          What can go wrong when I enter a prompt into Copilot for Azure?
        answer: |
          When you enter a prompt into Copilot for Azure, you might encounter the following issues:
          - Copilot for Azure might fail to choose a skill.
          - Copilot for Azure might not select the Defender for Cloud skill.
          - Copilot for Azure might select its own skill instead of a Defender for Cloud skill. For example, a skill belonging to Azure documentation, a skill focused on Azure alerts.
          - A Microsoft Security Copilot skill might be selected. For example, CVS related prompts can sometimes be answered by [Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/defender-external-attack-surface-management/) skills.
          - A Defender for Cloud skills is selected but the user doesn't have Microsoft Security Copilot security compute units (SCUs). Learn more about [managing the usage of SCUs in Microsoft Security Copilot](/copilot/security/manage-usage).
          - A Defender for Cloud skill is selected but the response can be blocked by security measures.


      - question: |
          Is it possible for a user to submit a prompt with the intentions of Microsoft Security Copilot of answering it and Azure Copilot answering it instead? 

        answer: |
          Yes. If you ask a question that doesn't relate to a skill that Defender for Cloud currently supports, Azure Copilot attempts to answer the question based on the skills and data available to it.



      - question: |
          How can I know which skills are currently supported?

        answer: |
          To get a better understanding of the skills that Defender for Cloud currently supports, check out [Analyze recommendations with Microsoft Security Copilot](analyze-with-copilot.md).



      - question: |
          Is there a way to determine which Copilot is responding to a user’s prompt? 

        answer: |
          Yes. When you submit a prompt, a progress screen appears. If the message `Using Microsoft Security Copilot` appears, then Azure Copilot passed along the prompt to Microsoft Security Copilot to respond.

      - question: |
          What happens when Azure Copilot or Microsoft Security Copilot can't handle a user prompt?

        answer: |
          If a prompt can't be answered by either Azure Copilot or Microsoft Security Copilot, a response stating "Sorry, I can't assist with that" will be displayed.



      - question: |
          I got a response from one of the Copilots that is inaccurate, what should I do?

        answer: |
          For any responses that somehow deviate from your expectations, we recommend using the feedback option that appears after the prompt by selecting up the thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons.



      - question: |
          Is there a way to force Azure Copilot to use Microsoft Security Copilot for all prompts?

        answer: |
          No.



      - question: |
          Will I be charged for using Azure Copilot if my skill is executed by Microsoft Security Copilot?

        answer: |
          No.
