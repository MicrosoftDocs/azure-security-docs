# SQL vulnerability assessment rules reference guide

This article lists the set of built-in rules that are used to flag security vulnerabilities and highlight deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations and excessive permissions. The rules are based on Microsoft's best practices and focus on the security issues that present the biggest risks to your database and its valuable data. They cover both database-level issues as well as server-level security issues, like server firewall settings and server-level permissions. These rules also represent many of the requirements from various regulatory bodies to meet their compliance standards.

This rule checks that this group is removed from SQL Server.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1053     |Account with default name `sa` should be renamed or disabled          |Low         |`sa` is a well-known account with principal ID 1. This rule verifies that the `sa` account is either renamed or disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1054     |Excessive permissions should not be granted to PUBLIC role on objects or columns          |Low         |Every SQL Server login belongs to the public server role. When a server principal has not been granted or denied specific permissions on a securable object the user inherits the permissions granted to public on that object. This rule displays a list of all securable objects or columns that are accessible to all users through the PUBLIC role.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Database         |
|VA1058     |`sa` login should be disabled          |High         |`sa` is a well-known account with principal ID 1. This rule verifies that the `sa` account is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |

|VA1070     |Database users shouldn't share the same name as a server login          |Low         |Database users might share the same name as a server login. This rule validates that there are no such users.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1072     |Authentication mode should be Windows Authentication          |Medium         |There are two possible authentication modes: Windows Authentication mode and mixed mode. Mixed mode means that SQL Server enables both Windows authentication and SQL Server authentication. This rule checks that the authentication mode is set to Windows Authentication.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1094     |Database permissions shouldn't be granted directly to principals          |Low         |Permissions are rules associated with a securable object to regulate which users can gain access to the object. This rule checks that there are no DB permissions granted directly to users.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1095     |Excessive permissions should not be granted to PUBLIC role          |Medium         |Every SQL Server login belongs to the public server role. When a server principal has not been granted or denied specific permissions on a securable object, the user inherits the permissions granted to public on that object. This displays a list of all permissions that are granted to the PUBLIC role.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database         |
|VA1096     |Principal GUEST should not be granted permissions in the database          |Low         |Each database includes a user called GUEST. Permissions granted to GUEST are inherited by users who have access to the database but who do not have a user account in the database. This rule checks that all permissions have been revoked from the GUEST user.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database         |

|VA1022     |Ad hoc distributed queries should be disabled          |Medium         |Ad hoc distributed queries use the `OPENROWSET` and `OPENDATASOURCE` functions to connect to remote data sources that use OLE DB. This rule checks that ad hoc distributed queries are disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1023     |CLR should be disabled          |High         |The CLR allows managed code to be hosted by and run in the Microsoft SQL Server environment. This rule checks that CLR is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1026     |CLR should be disabled          |Medium         |The CLR allows managed code to be hosted by and run in the Microsoft SQL Server environment. CLR strict security treats SAFE and EXTERNAL_ACCESS assemblies as if they were marked UNSAFE and requires all assemblies be signed by a certificate or asymmetric key with a corresponding login that has been granted UNSAFE ASSEMBLY permission in the master database. This rule checks that CLR is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2017+<sup>2</sup><nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1027     |Untracked trusted assemblies should be removed          |High         |Assemblies marked as UNSAFE are required to be signed by a certificate or asymmetric key with a corresponding login that has been granted UNSAFE ASSEMBLY permission in the master database.

|VA1044     |Remote Admin Connections should be disabled unless specifically required          |Medium         |This rule checks that remote dedicated admin connections are disabled if they are not being used for clustering to reduce attack surface area. SQL Server provides a dedicated administrator connection (DAC). The DAC lets an administrator access a running server to execute diagnostic functions or Transact-SQL statements, or to troubleshoot problems on the server and it becomes an attractive target to attack when it is enabled remotely.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1051     |AUTO_CLOSE should be disabled on all databases          |Medium         |The AUTO_CLOSE option specifies whether the database shuts down gracefully and frees resources after the last user disconnects. Regardless of its benefits it can cause denial of service by aggressively opening and closing the database, thus it is important to keep this feature disabled. This rule checks that this option is disabled on the current database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1066     |Unused service broker endpoints should be removed          |Low         |Service Broker provides queuing and reliable messaging for SQL Server. Service Broker is used both for applications that use a single SQL Server instance and applications that distribute work across multiple instances. Service Broker endpoints provide options for transport security and message forwarding. This rule enumerates all the service broker endpoints. Remove those that are not used.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1071     |'Scan for startup stored procedures' option should be disabled          |Medium         |When 'Scan for startup procs' is enabled SQL Server scans for and runs all automatically run stored procedures defined on the server. If this option is enabled SQL Server scans for and runs all automatically run stored procedures defined on the server.

|VA1092     |SQL Server instance shouldn't be advertised by the SQL Server Browser service          |Low         |SQL Server uses the SQL Server Browser service to enumerate instances of the Database Engine installed on the computer. This enables client applications to browse for a server and helps clients distinguish between multiple instances of the Database Engine on the same computer. This rule checks that the SQL instance is hidden.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1102     |The Trustworthy bit should be disabled on all databases except MSDB          |High         |The TRUSTWORTHY database property is used to indicate whether the instance of SQL Server trusts the database and the contents within it. If this option is enabled database modules (for example user-defined functions or stored procedures) that use an impersonation context can access resources outside the database. This rule verifies that the TRUSTWORTHY bit is disabled on all databases except MSDB.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1143     |'dbo' user should not be used for normal service operation          |Medium         |The 'dbo' or database owner is a user account that has implied permissions to perform all activities in the database. Members of the sysadmin fixed server role are automatically mapped to dbo. This rule checks that dbo is not the only account allowed to access this database. Note that on a newly created clean database this rule will fail until additional roles are created.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance<br/><br/>SQL Database<br/><br/>Azure Synapse         |
|VA1144     |Model database should only be accessible by 'dbo'          |Medium         |The Model database is used as the template for all databases created on the instance of SQL Server. Modifications made to the model database such as database size recovery model and other database options are applied to any databases created afterward. This rule checks that dbo is the only account allowed to access the model database.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA1230     |Filestream should be disabled          |High         |FILESTREAM integrates the SQL Server Database Engine with an NTFS file system by storing varbinary (max) binary large object (BLOB) data as files on the file system. Transact-SQL statements can insert, update, query, search, and back up FILESTREAM data. Enabling Filestream on SQL server exposes additional NTFS streaming API, which increases its attack surface and makes it prone to malicious attacks. This rule checks that Filestream is disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/>         |
|VA1235     |Server configuration 'Replication XPs' should be disabled          |Medium         |Disable the deprecated server configuration 'Replication XPs' to limit the attack surface area.

|VA2120     |Features that may affect security should be disabled          |High         |SQL Server is capable of providing a wide range of features and services. Some of the features and services provided by default might not be necessary and enabling them could adversely affect the security of the system. This rule checks that these features are disabled.         |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
|VA2121     | 'OLE Automation Procedures' feature should be disabled         |High         |SQL Server is capable of providing a wide range of features and services. Some of the features and services, provided by default, might not be necessary, and enabling them could adversely affect the security of the system. The OLE Automation Procedures option controls whether OLE Automation objects can be instantiated within Transact-SQL batches. These are extended stored procedures that allow SQL Server users to execute functions external to SQL Server. Regardless of its benefits it can also be used for exploits, and is known as a popular mechanism to plant files on the target machines. It is advised to use PowerShell as a replacement for this tool. This rule checks that 'OLE Automation Procedures' feature is disabled.          |<nobr>SQL Server 2012+<nobr/><br/><br/>SQL Managed Instance         |
