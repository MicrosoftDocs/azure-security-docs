# Configure Microsoft Defender for Containers components

Microsoft Defender for Containers is the cloud-native solution for securing your containers.

Defender for Containers protects your clusters whether they're running in:

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** - Microsoft's managed service for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications.

- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in a connected Amazon Web Services (AWS) account** - Amazon's managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in a connected Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project** - Googleâ€™s managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling applications using GCP infrastructure.

- **Other Kubernetes distributions** (using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes) - Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters hosted on-premises or on IaaS. For more information, see the **On-prem/IaaS (Arc)** section of [Supported features by environment](supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-containers.md#supported-features-by-environment).

Learn about this plan in [Overview of Microsoft Defender for Containers](defender-for-containers-introduction.md).

You can first learn how to connect and protect your containers in these articles:

- [Protect your Azure containers with Defender for Containers](tutorial-enable-containers-azure.md)
- [Protect your on-premises Kubernetes clusters with Defender for Containers](tutorial-enable-containers-arc.md)
- [Protect your Amazon Web Service (AWS) accounts containers with Defender for Containers](tutorial-enable-container-aws.md)
- [Protect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project containers with Defender for Containers](tutorial-enable-container-gcp.md)

## Simulate security alerts from Microsoft Defender for Containers

A full list of supported alerts is available in the [reference table of all Defender for Cloud security alerts](alerts-containers.md).

1. To simulate a security alert, run the following command from the cluster:

    ```console
    kubectl get pods --namespace=asc-alerttest-662jfi039n
    ```

    The expected response is `No resource found`.

    Within 30 minutes, Defender for Cloud detects this activity and trigger a security alert.
    > [!NOTE]
    > To simulate agentless alerts for Defender for Containers, Azure Arc isn't a prerequisite.

1. In the Azure portal, open Microsoft Defender for Cloud's security alerts page and look for the alert on the relevant resource:
