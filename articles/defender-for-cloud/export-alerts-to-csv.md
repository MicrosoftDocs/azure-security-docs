# Download a CSV report

Microsoft Defender for Cloud has the ability to export all alerts and recommendations to a CSV file. This feature is useful when you want to analyze the data in a different tool or share it with others.

> [!TIP]
> Due to Azure Resource Graph limitations, the reports are limited to a file size of 25,000 rows. If you see errors related to too much data being exported, try limiting the output by selecting a smaller set of subscriptions to be exported.

> [!NOTE]
> These reports contain alerts and recommendations for resources from the currently selected subscriptions.
