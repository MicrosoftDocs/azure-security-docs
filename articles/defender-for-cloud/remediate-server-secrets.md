# Remediate VM secrets issues

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides secrets scanning for virtual machines (VMs), and for cloud deployments, to reduce lateral movement risk.

This article helps you to identify and remediate security risks with VM secrets.

## Identifying and remediating secrets issue

There are a number of methods available to identify and mitigate secrets issues. Not every method is supported for every secret. Review the [supported secrets list](secrets-scanning.md#discovery-support) for more details.

- **Review secrets in the asset inventory**: The inventory shows the security state of resources connected to Defender for Cloud. From the inventory you can view the secrets discovered on a specific machine.
- **Review secrets recommendations**: When secrets are found on assets, a recommendation is triggered under the Remediate vulnerabilities security control on the Defender for Cloud Recommendations page. Recommendations are triggered as follows:
- **Review secrets with cloud security explorer**. Use cloud security explorer to query the cloud security graph. You can build your own queries, or use one of the built-in templates to query for VM secrets across your environment.
- **Review attack paths**: Attack path analysis scans the cloud security graph to expose exploitable paths that attacks might use to breach your environment and reach high-impact assets. VM secrets scanning supports a number of attack path scenarios.

Itâ€™s important to be able to prioritize secrets and identify which ones need immediate attention. To help you do this, Defender for Cloud provides:

- Providing rich metadata for every secret, such as last access time for a file, a token expiration date, an indication whether the target resource that the secrets provide access to exists, and more.
- Combining secrets metadata with cloud assets context. This helps you to start with assets that are exposed to the internet, or contain secrets that might compromise other sensitive assets. Secrets scanning findings are incorporated into risk-based recommendation prioritization.
- Providing multiple views to help you pinpoint the mostly commonly found secrets, or assets containing secrets.
    
## Secrets security recommendations

The following VM secrets security recommendations are available:

- Azure resources: Machines should have secrets findings resolved
- AWS resources: EC2 instances should have secrets findings resolved
- GCP resources: VM instances should have secrets findings resolved


### Secrets attack path scenarios

The table summarizes supported attack paths.

**VM** | **Attack paths**
--- | ---
Azure | Exposed Vulnerable VM has an insecure SSH private key that is used to authenticate to a VM.<br/>Exposed Vulnerable VM has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to a storage account.<br/>Vulnerable VM has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to a storage account.<br/>Exposed Vulnerable VM has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to an SQL server.
AWS | Exposed Vulnerable EC2 instance has an insecure SSH private key that is used to authenticate to an EC2 instance.<br/>Exposed Vulnerable EC2 instance has an insecure secret that is used to authenticate to a storage account.<br/>Exposed Vulnerable EC2 instance has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to an AWS RDS server.<br/>Vulnerable EC2 instance has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to an AWS RDS server.
GCP | Exposed Vulnerable GCP VM instance has an insecure SSH private key that is used to authenticate to a GCP VM instance.

## Predefined cloud security explorer queries

Defender for Cloud provides these predefined queries for investigating secrets security issues:

- VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to another VM - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access other VMs or EC2s.
- VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to a storage account - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access storage accounts
- VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to an SQL database - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access SQL databases.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, you can [create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- [Defender for Cloud](get-started.md) must be available in your Azure subscription.

- At least one of these plans [must be enabled](enable-enhanced-security.md#enable-defender-plans-to-get-the-enhanced-security-features):
  - [Defender for Servers Plan 2](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md)
  - [Defender CSPM](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md)

- [Agentless machine scanning](enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless.md#enabling-agentless-scanning-for-machines) must be enabled. Learn more about [agentless scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md#availability).

## Remediate secrets with attack paths

Attack path analysis is a graph-based algorithm that scans your [cloud security graph](concept-attack-path.md#what-is-cloud-security-graph) to expose exploitable paths that attackers might use to reach high-impact assets. Defender for Cloud provides several attack paths scenarios for VM secrets.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations** > **Attack path**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/secret-scanning/attack-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to navigate to your attack path in Defender for Cloud." lightbox="media/secret-scanning/attack-path.png":::

1. Select the relevant attack path.

1. Follow the remediation steps to remediate the attack path.

## Remediate secrets with recommendations

If a secret is found on your resource, that resource triggers an affiliated recommendation that is located under the Remediate vulnerabilities security control on the Recommendations page. Defender for Cloud provides a [number of VM secrets security recommendations](secrets-scanning-servers.md#security-recommendations).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Expand the **Remediate vulnerabilities** security control.

1. Select one of the [relevant recommendations](secrets-scanning-servers.md#security-recommendations).

    - **Azure resources**: `Machines should have secrets findings resolved`
    - **AWS resources**: `EC2 instances should have secrets findings resolved`
    - **GCP resources**: `VM instances should have secrets findings resolved`

        :::image type="content" source="media/secret-scanning/recommendation-findings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows either of the two results under the Remediate vulnerabilities security control." lightbox="media/secret-scanning/recommendation-findings.png":::

1. Expand **Affected resources** to review the list of all resources that contain secrets.

1. In the Findings section, select a secret to view detailed information about the secret.

    :::image type="content" source="media/secret-scanning/select-findings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the detailed information of a secret after you selected the secret in the findings section." lightbox="media/secret-scanning/select-findings.png":::

1. Expand **Remediation steps** and follow the listed steps.

1. Expand **Affected resources** to review the resources affected by this secret.

1. (Optional) You can select an affected resource to see the resource's information.

Secrets that don't have a known attack path are referred to as `secrets without an identified target resource`.

## Remediate secrets with cloud security explorer

The [cloud security explorer](concept-attack-path.md#what-is-cloud-security-explorer) enables you to proactively identify potential security risks within your cloud environment. It does so by querying the [cloud security graph](concept-attack-path.md#what-is-cloud-security-graph), which is the context engine of Defender for Cloud. Cloud security explorer provides a [number of query templates](secrets-scanning-servers.md#) for investigating VM secrets issues.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Cloud Security Explorer**.

1. Select one of the following templates:

    - **VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to another VM** - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access other VMs or EC2s.
    - **VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to a storage account** - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access storage accounts.
    - **VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to an SQL database** - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access SQL databases.

If you don't want to use any of the available templates, you can also [build your own query](how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer.md) in the cloud security explorer.

## Remediate secrets in the asset inventory

Your [asset inventory](asset-inventory.md) shows the [security posture](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) of the resources you connected to Defender for Cloud. You can view the secrets discovered on a specific machine.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Inventory**.

1. Select the relevant VM.

1. Go to the **Secrets** tab.

1. Review each plaintext secret that appears with the relevant metadata.

1. Select a secret to view extra details of that secret.

Different types of secrets have different sets of additional information. For example, for plaintext SSH private keys, the information includes related public keys (mapping between the private key to the authorized keysâ€™ file we discovered or mapping to a different virtual machine that contains the same SSH private key identifier).
