# Protect your Azure containers with Defender for Containers

Microsoft Defender for Containers is a cloud-native solution to improve, monitor, and maintain the security of your containerized assets (Kubernetes clusters, Kubernetes nodes, Kubernetes workloads, container registries, container images and more), and their applications, across multicloud and on-premises environments.

Learn more about [Overview of Microsoft Defender for Containers](defender-for-containers-introduction.md).

You can learn more about Defender for Container's pricing on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/). You can also [estimate costs with the Defender for Cloud cost calculator](cost-calculator.md).

## Prerequisites

- You need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [sign up for a free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

- You must [enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud](get-started.md#enable-defender-for-cloud-on-your-azure-subscription) on your Azure subscription.

- Ensure the [required Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN)/application](/azure/aks/limit-egress-traffic) endpoints are configured for outbound access so the Defender sensor can connect to Microsoft Defender for Cloud to send security data and events.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound (egress) internet access.

## Enable the Defender for Containers plan

By default, when enabling the plan through the Azure portal, Microsoft Defender for Containers is configured to automatically enable all capabilities and install required components to provide the protections offered by plan, including the assignment of a default workspace.

If you would prefer to [assign a custom workspace](defender-for-containers-enable.md?pivots=defender-for-container-aks&tabs=aks-deploy-portal%2Ck8s-deploy-asc%2Ck8s-verify-asc%2Ck8s-remove-arc%2Caks-removeprofile-api#assign-a-custom-workspace), one can be assigned through the Azure Policy.
