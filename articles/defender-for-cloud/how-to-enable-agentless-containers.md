# Onboard agentless container posture in Defender CSPM

Onboarding agentless container posture in Defender CSPM allows you to gain all its [capabilities](concept-agentless-containers.md#capabilities).

> [!NOTE]
> Agentless container posture is available for Azure, AWS, and GCP clouds.

Defender CSPM includes [two extensions](faq-defender-for-containers.yml#what-are-the-extensions-for-agentless-container-posture-management-) that allow for agentless visibility into Kubernetes and containers registries across your organization's software development lifecycle.

## How to onboard agentless container posture in Defender CSPM

1. Before starting, verify that the scope is [onboarded to Defender CSPM](enable-enhanced-security.md).

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Defender for Cloud's **Environment Settings** page.

1. Select the scope that's onboarded to the Defender CSPM plan, then select **Settings**.

1. Ensure the **K8S API access** and **Registry access** extensions are toggled to **On**.
