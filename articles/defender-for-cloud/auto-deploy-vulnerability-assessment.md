# Overview - Vulnerability scanning for machines

The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides vulnerability scanning using Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management. 

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Defender Vulnerability Management are [integrated natively into Defender for Servers](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md). Integrated vulnerability assessment provides a number of benefits:


- **Scanning consistency**: Use a consistent vulnerability scanner across a range of use cases, in multicloud environments, and different host runtimes.
- **Risk reduction**: Discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in near real time.
- **Prioritization**: Prioritize vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape and detections in your organization.
- **Software inventory**: Get information about your [software inventory](asset-inventory.md#review-software-inventory).
- **Premium features**: Leverage Defender Vulnerability Management premium features in Defender for Servers Plan 2, including certificate asessment, baseline assessment, vulnerable application blocking, and more.

Vulnerability scanning with Defender Vulnerability Management is supported for Azure VMs,  [AWS](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) and [GCP](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) machines connected to Defender for Cloud, and on-premises VMs that are [onboarded as Azure Arc VMs](quickstart-onboard-machines.md).

## Agent-based and agentless scanning

Vulnerability scanning with integrated Defender Vulnerability Management takes a hybrid approach in Defender for Cloud:

- **Agentless vulnerability scanning**. Defender for Cloud provides agentless vulnerability scanning as part of its [agentless scanning capabilities](concept-agentless-data-collection.md). Agentless scanning is available in Defender for Servers Plan 2 only.
- **Agent-based vulnerability scanning**. The [Defender for Endpoint integration](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) in Defender for Servers provides vulnerability scanning using the Defender for Endpoint sensor. This integration is available in Defender for Servers Plan 1 and Plan 2.

## Bring your own license (BYOL)

Instead of using integrated Defender Vulnerability Management scanning, you can use your own privately BYOL vulnerability scanner. Qualys and Rapid7 scanners are supported.

These scanners report vulnerability data to the partner management platform, and in turn that platform provides vulnerability and health data back to Defender for Cloud. You don't need a paid plan switched on in Defender for Cloud to use a third-party vulnerability solution.

- [Enable vulnerability scanning with a BYOL scanner](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md).


## Hybrid scanning behavior

Agentless scanning extends the visibility of Defender for Cloud to reach more devices. If agentless vulnerability scanning is enabled, the following occurs:

**Solution<br/>(agentless scanning switched on)** | **Details**
--- | ---
**No solution** | If you don't have an agent-based vulnerability scanning solution enabled on VMs , Defender for Cloud automatically scans agentless with Defender Vulnerability Management.
**Defender Vulnerability Management integration** | If machines are running the Defender for Endpoint agent, Defender for Cloud shows a unified view of vulnerability assessment with optimized coverage and freshness.<br/><br/>- Machines using agent-based scanning **OR** agentless scanning show the results from that enabled source only.<br/>- Machines with both agent-based and agentless scanning show the agent-based results only, for better freshness.
**BYOL solution** | If you're using a [partner vulnerability assessment solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md), Defender for Cloud shows scanning results from the partner solution by default. Agentless scan result are shown for machines that don't have the partner agent installed, for machines that aren't reporting findings correctly.<br/><br/> You can modify this default behavior to always display results from Defender Vulnerability Management, regardless of whether a third-party agent solution is installing, by [manually enabling](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management.md#enable-vulnerability-scanning-on-a-subscription) the **Vulnerability assessment for machines** option in the **Environment settings** page of Defender for Cloud.


## Premium vulnerability management features

Defender for Servers Plan 2 includes Defender Vulnerability Management premium add-on capabilities that provide consolidated inventories, new assessments, and mitigation tools to further enhance your vulnerability management program.
