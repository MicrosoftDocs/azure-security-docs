# Vulnerability scanning for machines

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides vulnerability scanning with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management. Defender Vulnerability Management is integrated natively into the Defender for Servers plan, as part of the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md). This integrated vulnerability assessment solution provides a number of benefits:


- **Consistency**: Defeinder Vulnerability Management integration provides a consistent vulnerability scanner across a range of use cases, in multicloud environments, and different host runtimes.

- **Risk reduction**: Discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in near real time.
- **Prioritization**: Prioritizes vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape and detections in your organization.
- **Software inventory**: Provides information about your [software inventory](asset-inventory.md#review-software-inventory).
- **Premium features**: Provide Defender Vulnerability Management premium features in Defender for Servers Plan 2, including certificate asessment, baseline assessment, vulnerable application blocking, and more.


## Multicloud support

Vulnerability scanning with Defender Vulnerability Management is supported for Azure VMs, multicloud machines connected with the [AWS](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) or [GCP](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) connector, and on-premises VMs that are onboarded as Azure Arc VMs.


## Hybrid vulnerability scanning

Vulnerability scanning takes a hybrid approach in Defender for Cloud:

- **Agentless vulnerability scanning**. Defender for Cloud provides [agentless machine scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md) that includes agentless vulnerability scanning. Agentless scanning is provided with Defender for Servers Plan 2 only.
- **Agent-based vulnerability scanning**. The default Defender for Endpoint/Defender for Vulnerability Management integration in Defender for Cloud provides vulnerability scanning. This integration is in Defender for Servers Plan 1 and Plan 2. [Learn more](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md).

## Bring your own license

Instead of using integrated Defender Vulnerability Management scanning, you can use your own bring your own privately licensed (BYOL) scanner. Qualys and Rapid7 scanners are supported.

These scanners report vulnerability data to the partner management platform, and in turn that platform provides vulnerability and health data back to Defender for Cloud.

- [Enable vulnerability scanning with a BYOL scanner](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md).

## Hybrid scanning behavior

Agentless scanning extends the visibility of Defender for Cloud to reach more devices. When you have agentless vulnerability assessment enabled, the following occurs:

**Vulnerability solution** | **Details**
--- | ---
**No vulnerability solution on VM** | If you don't have an existing integrated vulnerability method enabled on VMs in a subscription, Defender for Cloud automatically scans with Defender Vulnerability Management by default.
**Using Defender Vulnerability Management [integrated with Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md)** | Defender for Cloud shows a unified and consolidated view of vulnerability assessment that optimizes coverage and freshness.<br/><br/>- Machines covered by just one source (Defender Vulnerability Management or agentless) show the results from that source.<br/><br/>-  Machines covered by both sources show the agent-based results only for increased freshness.
**Using a BYOL solution** | If you using a [partner vulnerability assessment solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md), Defender for Cloud shows the agent-based results by default. Results from the agentless scan are shown for machines that don't have an agent installed or from machines that aren't reporting findings correctly.<br/><br/> You can modify this default behavior to always display results from Defender Vulnerability Management, regardless of whether a third-party agent solution is installing, by [manually configuring the Defender Vulnerability Management option](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management#manually-configure-vulnerability-scanning-on-a-subscription) setting in the vulnerability assessment solution.


## Premium vulnerability management features

Defender for Servers Plan 2 includes Defender Vulnerability Management premium add-on capabilities that provide consolidated inventories, new assessments, and mitigation tools to further enhance your vulnerability management program.
