# Vulnerability scanning for machines

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides vulnerability scanning with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management. Defender Vulnerability Management is integrated by default into the Defender for Servers plan, along with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This integrated solution provides a number of benefits:


- **Consistency**: Provides a consistent vulnerability scanner across a range of use cases, in multicloud environments, and different host runtimes.
- **Hybrid approach**: Vulnerability scanning takes a hybrid approach in Defender for Cloud:
    - **Agentless** scanning. Defender for Cloud provides [agentless machine scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md). Agentless machine scanning includes agentless vulnerability scanning. Agentless scanning is provided with Defender for Servers Plan 2 only.
    - **Agent-based scanning**. You can use the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent for vulnerability scanning. Defender for Endpoint/Defender Vulnerability Management integration is available for both Defender for Servers Plan 1, and for Plan 2. [Learn more](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md).
- **Risk reduction**: Discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in near real time.
- **Prioritization**: Prioritizes vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape and detections in your organization.
- **Software inventory**: Provides information about your [software inventory](asset-inventory.md#access-a-software-inventory).
- **Premium features**: Provide Defender Vulnerability Management premium features in Defender for Servers Plan 2, including certificate assessment, baseline assessment, vulnerable application blocking, and more.

## Enabling vulnerability scanning

Defender for Cloud supports both agentless and agent-based vulnerability scanning. Agentless scanning extends the visibility of Defender for Cloud to reach more devices. When you have agentless vulnerability assessment enabled, the following occurs:

**Vulnerability solution** | **Details**
--- | ---
**No vulnerability solution on VM** | If you don't have an existing integrated vulnerability method enabled on any of your VMs on your subscription, Defender for Cloud automatically scanning with Defender Vulnerability Management by default.
**Using Defender Vulnerability Management [integrated with Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md)** | Defender for Cloud shows a unified and consolidated view of vulnerability assessment that optimizes coverage and freshness.<br/><br/>- Machines covered by just one source (Defender Vulnerability Management or agentless) show the results from that source.<br/><br/>-  Machines covered by both sources show the agent-based results only for increased freshness.
**Using a BYOL solution** | If you're using a [partner vulnerability assessment solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md), Defender for Cloud shows the agent-based results by default. Results from the agentless scan are shown for machines that don't have an agent installed or from machines that aren't reporting findings correctly.<br/><br/> You can modify this default behavior to always display results from Defender Vulnerability Management, regardless of whether a third-party agent solution is installing, by [manually configuring the Defender Vulnerability Management option](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management#manually-configure-vulnerability-scanning-on-a-subscription) setting in the vulnerability assessment solution.


## Premium vulnerability management features

Defender for Servers Plan 2 includes Defender Vulnerability Management premium add-on capabilities that provide consolidated inventories, new assessments, and mitigation tools to further enhance your vulnerability management program. Learn more about [Vulnerability Management capabilities for servers](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management-capabilities#vulnerability-management-capabilities-for-endpoints).


## Multicloud support

Vulnerability scanning with Defender Vulnerability Management is supported for Azure VMs, multicloud machines connected with the [AWS](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) or [GCP](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) connector, and on-premises VMs that are onboarded as Azure Arc VMs.


## Bring your own license

Instead of using integrated Defender Vulnerability Management scanning, you can use your own bring your own privately licensed (BYOL) scanner. Qualys and Rapid7 scanners are supported.

These scanners report vulnerability data to the partner management platform, and in turn that platform provides vulnerability and health data back to Defender for Cloud.
