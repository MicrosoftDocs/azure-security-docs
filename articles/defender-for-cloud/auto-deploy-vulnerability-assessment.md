Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management has a new home under **Exposure Management** and now supports both Cloud and Devices environments. Access vulnerability scanning capabilities through **Exposure Management** > **Vulnerability Management** > **Overview** > **Cloud tab** in the Microsoft Defender portal. 

This centralized experience provides comprehensive vulnerability insights across your cloud infrastructure, including:
- **Cloud vulnerabilities overview**: Key metrics and trends for cloud-specific vulnerabilities
- **Top cloud CVEs**: Most critical vulnerabilities affecting your cloud resources
- **Top cloud recommendations**: Prioritized remediation guidance
- **Recommendations by resource type**: Vulnerability insights organized by workload categories
- **Vulnerable resources insights**: Detailed analysis of affected assets

The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides vulnerability scanning for connected machines, now accessible through the unified Vulnerability Management dashboard under Exposure Management in the Defender portal.

For detailed vulnerability analysis, navigate to **Exposure Management** > **Vulnerability Management** > **Vulnerabilities** > **Cloud** to view all cloud-specific vulnerabilities with enhanced filtering and risk-based prioritization alongside device vulnerabilities in a unified experience.

Key benefits of the integrated Exposure Management approach:
- **Unified vulnerability view**: Both cloud and device vulnerabilities in a single interface
- **Contextual risk assessment**: Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on environmental context and attack path analysis
- **Cross-platform insights**: Comprehensive view across endpoints and cloud environments
- **Enhanced remediation workflows**: Streamlined processes connecting vulnerabilities to broader security operations

- Integrated vulnerability scanning in Defender for Cloud uses Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.
- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, together with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is [integrated natively into Defender for Servers](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md).

## Enable vulnerability scanning for machines

The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides vulnerability scanning for connected machines.

- Integrated vulnerability scanning in Defender for Cloud uses Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.
- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, together with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is [integrated natively into Defender for Servers](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md).

::: zone-end

Integrated vulnerability assessment provides many benefits:

- **Scanning consistency**: Use a consistent vulnerability scanner across a range of use cases, in multicloud environments, and different host runtimes.
- **Risk reduction**: Discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in near real time.
- **Prioritization**: Prioritize vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape and detections in your organization.
- **Software inventory**: Get information about your [software inventory](asset-inventory.md#review-software-inventory).
- **Premium features**: Use Defender Vulnerability Management premium features in Defender for Servers Plan 2, including certificate assessment, baseline assessment, vulnerable application blocking, and more.

Vulnerability scanning with Defender Vulnerability Management is supported for Azure VMs,  [AWS](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) and [GCP](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) machines connected to Defender for Cloud, and on-premises VMs that are [onboarded as Azure Arc VMs](quickstart-onboard-machines.md).

## Agent-based and agentless scanning

Vulnerability scanning with integrated Defender Vulnerability Management takes a hybrid approach in Defender for Cloud:

- **Agentless vulnerability scanning**. Defender for Cloud provides agentless vulnerability scanning as part of its [agentless scanning capabilities](concept-agentless-data-collection.md). Agentless scanning is available in Defender for Servers Plan 2 only.
- **Agent-based vulnerability scanning**. The [Defender for Endpoint integration](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) in Defender for Servers provides vulnerability scanning using the Defender for Endpoint sensor. This integration is available in Defender for Servers Plan 1 (P1) and Plan 2 (P2).

## Bring your own license (BYOL)

Instead of using integrated Defender Vulnerability Management scanning, you can use your own privately licensed BYOL vulnerability scanner. Qualys and Rapid7 scanners are supported.

Here's how it works:

- Supported solutions report vulnerability data to the partner's management platform.
- Solution platforms provide vulnerability and health monitoring data back to Defender for Cloud.

You can identify vulnerable machines in Defender for Cloud, and then switch to the partner management console directly from Defender for Cloud for reports and more information.

You don't need a paid plan switched on in Defender for Cloud to use a non-Microsoft vulnerability solution.

## Hybrid scanning behavior

Agentless scanning extends the visibility of Defender for Cloud to reach more devices. If agentless vulnerability scanning is enabled, the following occurs:

**Solution<br/>(agentless scanning switched on)** | **Details**
--- | ---
**No solution** | If you don't have an agent-based vulnerability scanning solution enabled on VMs, Defender for Cloud automatically scans agentless with Defender Vulnerability Management.
**Defender Vulnerability Management integration** | If machines are running the Defender for Endpoint agent, Defender for Cloud shows a unified view of vulnerability assessment with optimized coverage and freshness.<br/><br/>- Machines using agent-based scanning **OR** agentless scanning show the results from that enabled source only.<br/>- Machines with both agent-based and agentless scanning show the agent-based results only, for better freshness.
**BYOL solution** | If you're using a [partner vulnerability assessment solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md), Defender for Cloud shows scanning results from the partner solution by default. Agentless scan results are shown for machines that don't have the partner agent installed, for machines that aren't reporting findings correctly.<br/><br/> You can modify this default behavior to always display results from Defender Vulnerability Management, regardless of whether a non-Microsoft agent solution is installing, by [manually enabling](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management.md#enable-vulnerability-scanning-on-a-subscription) the **Vulnerability assessment for machines** option in the **Environment settings** page of Defender for Cloud.

## Premium vulnerability management features

Defender for Servers Plan 2 includes Defender Vulnerability Management premium add-on capabilities that provide consolidated inventories, new assessments, and mitigation tools to further enhance your vulnerability management program.
