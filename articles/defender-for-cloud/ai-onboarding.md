# Enable threat protection for AI workloads (preview)

Threat protection for AI workloads in Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects AI workloads on an Azure subscription by providing insights to threats that might affect your generative AI applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Threat protection for AI workloads is currently in preview.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites

- Read up on [Overview - AI threat protection](ai-threat-protection.md).

- You need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [sign up for a free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

- You must [enable Defender for Cloud](get-started.md#enable-defender-for-cloud-on-your-azure-subscription) on your Azure subscription.

- We recommend that you don't opt out of prompt based prompt-base triggered alerts for [Azure OpenAI content filtering](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter). If you opt out of prompt-based trigger alerts and remove that capability, it can affect Defender for Cloud's ability to monitor and detect such attacks.
