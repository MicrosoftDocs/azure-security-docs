# Cluster Security Dashboard views and actions

The Cluster Security Dashboard gives the user the ability to view and take action to remediate an individual cluster's security posture.

The Cluster Security Dashboard allows the user to:
- View the security posture of the cluster.
- Enable Defender for Cloud plans for the specific cluster resource.
- Review vulnerability assessment recommendations for containers and node pools.
- Review cluster misconfigurations.
- Remediate the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Assign an owner to a recommendation or misconfiguration responsible for remediation by a specified date.
