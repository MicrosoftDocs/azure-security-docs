# Identify SQL Servers protected by Microsoft Monitor Agent

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Defender for SQL Server on Machines plan provides database security to protect SQL Server instances hosted on Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and on-premises machines. With the retirement of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA), on August 1,2024, the Defender for SQL Server on Machines plan requires meeting the [required perquisites](defender-for-sql-usage.md#prerequisites) and deploying Azure Arc on all non-Azure SQL Server instances.

Once Azure Arc is deployed and following the [release on the updated agent](release-notes.md#update-to-defender-for-sql-servers-on-machines-plan), your SQL Server instances will migrate automatically and seamlessly to the updated agent. To ensure your SQL servers are correctly protected, we recommend the [installation of Azure Arc](quickstart-onboard-machines.md#connect-on-premises-machines-by-using-azure-arc).

> [!NOTE]
>  This change might affect your pricing. For information regarding the plan pricing, review [Microsoft Defender for Cloud pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).

## Determine which SQL servers are protected by the legacy MMA

You can identify SQL servers onboarded to the Defender for SQL Server on Machines plan with the legacy MMA in your environment without Azure Arc installed.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select **Azure Resource Graph Explorer**.

1. Copy and paste the following query into the query window: 

    ```kusto
    securityresources 
    | where type == "microsoft.security/assessments/subassessments" 
    | extend assessmentKey = extract(@"(?i)providers/Microsoft.Security/assessments/([^/]*)", 1, id) 
    | where assessmentKey == "f97aa83c-9b63-4f9a-99f6-b22c4398f936" 
    | where tostring(properties.resourceDetails.source) == "OnPremiseSql" 
    | extend lastScanTime = todatetime(properties.timeGenerated) 
    | where lastScanTime > ago(30d) 
    | extend machineName = tostring(properties.resourceDetails.machineName) 
    | extend machineUuid = tostring(properties.resourceDetails.vmuuid) 
    | distinct machineName, machineUuid
    ```

1. Select **Run query**.

1. For any results returned, [connect hybrid machines with Azure Arc-enabled servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/learn/quick-enable-hybrid-vm).
