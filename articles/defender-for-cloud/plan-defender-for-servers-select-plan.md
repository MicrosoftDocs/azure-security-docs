# Select a Defender for Servers plan

This article helps you select the Microsoft Defender for Servers plan that's right for your organization.

Defender for Servers is one of the paid plans provided by [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](defender-for-cloud-introduction.md).

## Before you begin

This article is the *fourth* article in the Defender for Servers planning guide. Before you begin, review the earlier articles:

1. [Start planning your deployment](plan-defender-for-servers.md)
1. [Understand where your data is stored and Log Analytics workspace requirements](plan-defender-for-servers-data-workspace.md)
1. [Review access and role requirements](plan-defender-for-servers-roles.md)

## Review plans

You can choose from two paid plans:

- **Defender for Servers Plan 1** is entry-level and must be enabled at the subscription level. Features include:

  - [Foundational cloud security posture management (CSPM)](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md), which is provided free by Defender for Cloud.

    - For Azure virtual machines and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) machines, you don't need a Defender for Cloud plan enabled to use foundational CSPM features.
    - For on-premises server, to receive configuration recommendations machines must be onboarded to Azure with Azure Arc, and Defender for Servers must be enabled.

  - Endpoint detection and response (EDR) features that are provided by [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-plan-1-2).

- **Defender for Servers Plan 2** provides all features. The plan must be enabled at the subscription level and at the workspace level to get full feature coverage. Features include:

  - All the functionality that's provided by Defender for Servers Plan 1.
  - More extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> Plan 1 and Plan 2 for Defender for Servers aren't the same as Plan 1 and Plan 2 for Defender for Endpoint.

## Select a vulnerability assessment solution

A couple of vulnerability assessment options are available in Defender for Servers:

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management-capabilities): Integrated with Defender for Endpoint.

  - Available in Defender for Servers Plan 1 and Defender for Servers Plan 2.
  - Defender Vulnerability Management is enabled by default on machines that are onboarded to Defender for Endpoint.
  - Has the same [Windows](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints#prerequisites), [Linux](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux#prerequisites), and [network](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-proxy-internet#enable-access-to-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server) prerequisites as Defender for Endpoint.
  - No extra software is required.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management Add-on capabilities are included in Defender for Servers Plan 2. This provides consolidated inventories, new assessments, and mitigation tools to further enhance your vulnerability management program. To learn more, see [Vulnerability Management capabilities for servers](/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management-capabilities#vulnerability-managment-capabilities-for-servers).
    >
    > Defender Vulnerability Management add-on capabilities are only available through the [Microsoft Defender 365 portal](https://security.microsoft.com/homepage).
