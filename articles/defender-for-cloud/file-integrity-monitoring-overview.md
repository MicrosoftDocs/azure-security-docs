# Overview - File integrity monitoring

In the Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, the file integrity monitoring feature provides visibility into machine changes by examining operating system files, Windows registries, application software, and Linux system files to detect suspicious tampering activity such as file and registry modifications.

File integrity monitoring uses [Azure Automation change tracking](/azure/automation/change-tracking/overview) so that you can monitor changes directly in Defender for Cloud. 


> [!Note]
> There are some upcoming changes for file integrity monitoring.
> - The MMA is set to retire, and file integrity monitoring using the MMA will be deprecated in November 2024. File integrity monitoring using the AMA in preview is no longer supported.
> - A new version of file integrity monitoring using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent that's integrated by default with Defender for Servers is [now available in preview](file-integrity-monitoring-enable-defender-endpoint.md)

## Defender for Endpoint monitoring

When file integrity monitoring uses integrated Defender for Endpoint, the Defender for Endpoint sensor collects data from machines in accordance with data collection rules. When the current state of your system files is compared with the state during the previous scan, file integrity monitoring notifies you about suspicious modifications.

Using the Defender for Endpoint sensor, you can: 

- Monitor changes made to critical files and Windows registries from a predefined list in real-time.
- Access and analyze the audited changes in a designated Workspace.
- Take advantage of the 500-MB benefit included in the Defender for Servers Plan 2.
- Maintain compliance: FIM offers built-in support for relevant security regulatory compliance standards, such as PCI-DSS, CIS, NIST, and others


## Agent-based monitoring

File integrity monitoring can use the [Log Analytics agent (also known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA))](/azure/automation/change-tracking/overview) in general availability (GA), or the [Azure Monitoring Agent (AMA)](/azure/automation/change-tracking/overview-monitoring-agent) in preview to collect information.

- With MMA, when file integrity monitoring is enabled on a workspace the MMA collects change data from devices in accordance with workspace configuration settings, and sends it to the workspace for analysis.
- With AMA, when file integrity monitoring is enabled, the AMA collects change data from devices in accordance with data collection rules that define a list of files and registries to track. You can use default data collection rules, or customize. Changes are sent to a Log Analytics workspace that you specify when you turn on file integrity monitoring. You can customize the workspace used for file integrity monitoring.
- Workspaces with file integrity monitoring enabled have the **Azure Change Tracking** monitoring solution configured. If you remove the solution directly from the workspace, file integrity monitoring is disabled.



## Monitoring suspicious activity

File integrity monitoring informs you about potentially suspicious activity such as:

- File and registry key creation or deletion.
- File modifications, such as changes in file size, access control lists, and hash of the content)
- Registry modifications such as changes in size, access control lists, type, and content)

File integrity monitoring provides details about the change, including the source of the change, account details, indication of who made the changes, and information about the initiating process.

## Choosing what to monitor

Defender for Cloud recommends entities to monitor with file integrity monitoring, and you can define your own entities. When choosing which files to monitor:

- Consider the files that are critical for your system and applications.
- Monitor files that you donâ€™t expect to change without planning. 
- If you choose files that are frequently changed by applications or operating system (such as log files and text files) it will create noise, making it difficult to identify an attack.


## Recommended items to monitor

Defender for Cloud recommends monitoring these items based on known attack patterns.
