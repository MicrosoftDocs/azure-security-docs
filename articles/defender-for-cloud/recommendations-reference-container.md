# Container security recommendations

This article lists all the container security recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

The recommendations that appear in your environment are based on the resources that you're protecting and on your customized configuration.


> [!TIP]
> If a recommendation description says *No related policy*, usually it's because that recommendation is dependent on a different recommendation.
>
> For example, the recommendation *Endpoint protection health failures should be remediated* relies on the recommendation that checks whether an endpoint protection solution is installed (*Endpoint protection solution should be installed*). The underlying recommendation *does* have a policy.
> Limiting policies to only foundational recommendations simplifies policy management.




## Azure container recommendations



### [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters should have the Azure Policy extension installed](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/0642d770-b189-42ef-a2ce-9dcc3ec6c169)

### [(Enable if required) Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/af560c4d-9c05-e073-b9f1-f7a94958ff25)

**Description**: Recommendations to use customer-managed keys for encryption of data at rest are not assessed by default, but are available to enable for applicable scenarios. Data is encrypted automatically using platform-managed keys, so the use of customer-managed keys should only be applied when obligated by compliance or restrictive policy requirements.
To enable this recommendation, navigate to your Security Policy for the applicable scope, and update the *Effect* parameter for the corresponding policy to audit or enforce the use of customer-managed keys. Learn more in [Manage security policies](tutorial-security-policy.md).
Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of the contents of your registries. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys (CMK) are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. CMKs enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more about CMK encryption at [Overview of customer-managed keys](/azure/container-registry/tutorial-customer-managed-keys).
(Related policy: [Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f5b9159ae-1701-4a6f-9a7a-aa9c8ddd0580)).

**Description**: Azure container registries by default accept connections over the internet from hosts on any network. To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have an IP/firewall rule or a configured virtual network, it will appear in the unhealthy resources. Learn more about Container Registry network rules at [Configure public IP network rules](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-access-selected-networks) and [Restrict access to a container registry using a service endpoint in an Azure virtual network](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-vnet).
(Related policy: [Container registries should not allow unrestricted network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fd0793b48-0edc-4296-a390-4c75d1bdfd71)).

**Severity**: Medium

**Description**: Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your container registries instead of the entire service, you'll also be protected against data leakage risks. Learn more at: <https://aka.ms/acr/private-link>.
(Related policy: [Container registries should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fe8eef0a8-67cf-4eb4-9386-14b0e78733d4)).

**Description**: Restrict pod access to the host network and the allowable host port range in a Kubernetes cluster. Pods created with the hostNetwork attribute enabled will share the node's network space. To avoid compromised container from sniffing network traffic, we recommend not putting your pods on the host network. If you need to expose a container port on the node's network, and using a Kubernetes Service node port does not meet your needs, another possibility is to specify a hostPort for the container in the pod spec.
(Related policy: [Kubernetes cluster pods should only use approved host network and port range](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f82985f06-dc18-4a48-bc1c-b9f4f0098cfe)).
