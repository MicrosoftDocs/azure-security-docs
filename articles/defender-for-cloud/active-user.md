# Assign a recommendation to an Active User

Defender for Cloudâ€™s Active User feature helps security administrators identify the most active users responsible for remediation recommendations. Security administrators must monitor and address potential threats such as attack paths and their associated recommendations to secure cloud resources. 

The Active User feature suggests up to three potential active users. The suggestion is based on the users control plane activities on the specific resource, its related resource group, or the associated subscription. This feature improves the speed and efficiency of the remediation process and strengthens overall security posture. 

Security administrators can assign and the recommendation directly to the most appropriate user from the suggested active user list. The assigned user receives a notification and a due date for remediation, which eliminates the need for manual investigation to determine responsibility. This approach streamlines the workflow and saves time for security teams.

## Prerequisites

- [Enable the Defender for Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) plan](tutorial-enable-cspm-plan.md).

- You have one of the following roles and permissions: 
  - Security Administrator
  - Owner
  - Contributor

- [Review the Cloud availability](support-matrix-cloud-environment.md).
