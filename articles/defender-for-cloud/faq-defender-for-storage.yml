      - question: |
          Is it possible to enable Defender for Storage on a resource level?
        answer: |
          Yes, it's possible to enable Defender for Storage at the resource level and set up malware scanning and sensitivity scanning accordingly. Keep in mind that enabling it at the subscription level is the recommended approach, since it automatically protects all new storage accounts.

          Yes, you can exclude storage accounts from protection.


      - question: |
          How long does it take for subscription-level enablement to take effect?
        answer: |
          Enabling Defender for Storage at the subscription level might take up to 24 hours to be fully enabled across all storage accounts.


      - question: |
          Can I switch back to the Defender for Storage (classic)?
        answer: |
           No. Once you switch to the new plan, you can no longer revert to the Defender for Storage (classic) per-transaction or per-storage account plans. 

          > [!NOTE]
          > After February 5, 2025, you can no longer enable Defender for Storage (classic), the legacy per-transaction pricing plan, in most scenarios. The only exception is for subscriptions that already have the per-transaction pricing enabled. For more information, learn how to [migrate to the new plan](https://aka.ms/DF-Storage/NewPlanMigration).
