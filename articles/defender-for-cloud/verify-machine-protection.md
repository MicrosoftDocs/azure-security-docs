# Verify SQL machine protection

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article applies to commercial clouds. If you're using Government clouds, see the [Verify SQL machine protection government](verify-machine-protection-gov.md) article.

After enabling protection for SQL Servers installed on Virtual Machines (VM), on-premises machines, and multicloud resources with the Defender for SQL Servers on Machines plan, verify that your SQL servers are protected as expected.

## Verify protection on an entire Azure subscription

Defender for Cloud presents [The status of Microsoft SQL Servers on Machines should be protected](https://aka.ms/NewStatusRecommendation) recommendation. This recommendation allows you to review the protection status of Defender for SQL Servers on Machines. The recommendation identifies all SQL VMs and Azure Arc SQL Server instances within a specified Azure subscription, and presents the protection status of each SQL Server instance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Search for and select [The status of Microsoft SQL Servers on Machines should be protected](https://aka.ms/NewStatusRecommendation).

1. Select **View recommendation for all resources**.

1. Review the protection status and the unhealthy reason.

1. Select the unhealthy resource.

1. Follow the troubleshooting guide steps starting at [Step 3: Identify and resolve protection misconfigurations at the SQL Server instance Level](troubleshoot-sql-machines-guide.md#step-3-identify-and-resolve-protection-misconfigurations-at-the-sql-server-instance-level).

Defender for Cloud updates the status of the recommendation every 12 hours. Follow the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshoot-sql-machines-guide.md) to fix each unprotected SQL server instance.

## Verify protection on a single SQL server VM

You can also verify the protection status of a single SQL server VM or Azure Arc SQL Server instance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Depending on the resources in your environment, search for and select either:
    - **SQL virtual machines**
    <br> 
    or
    - **SQL Server - Azure Arc**

1. Locate and select the relevant resource.

1. Under the **Security** tab, select **Defender for Cloud**.

1. Check the **Protection status**. If the status is **Protected**, the deployment was successful.

    :::image type="content" source="media/verify-machines-protection/protection-status-protected.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing protection status as protected." lightbox="media/verify-machines-protection/protection-status-protected.png":::

1. (Optional) Resolve the unprotected server instance status with the [troubleshooting SQL Server on Machines guide](troubleshoot-sql-machines-guide.md).

Defender for Cloud updates the status of the recommendation every 12 hours. Follow the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshoot-sql-machines-guide.md) to fix each unprotected SQL server instance.
