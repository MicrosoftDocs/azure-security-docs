# Enable and configure with REST API

We recommend that you enable Defender for Storage on the subscription level. Doing so ensures all storage accounts currently in the subscription will be protected. Storage accounts that are created after enabling Defender for Storage on the subscription level will be protected up to 24 hours after creation.

> [!TIP]
> You can always [configure specific storage accounts](/azure/storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdefender-for-cloud%2Ftoc.json&tabs=enable-subscription#override-defender-for-storage-subscription-level-settings) with custom configurations that differ from the settings configured at the subscription level (override subscription-level settings).

## [Enable on a subscription](#tab/enable-subscription/)

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage at the subscription level using REST API, create a PUT request with this endpoint (replace the `subscriptionId` in the endpoint URL with your own Azure subscription ID):

```rest
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/pricings/StorageAccounts?api-version=2023-01-01

```

And add the following request body:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "extensions": [
            {
                "name": "OnUploadMalwareScanning",
                "isEnabled": "True",
                "additionalExtensionProperties": {
                    "CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount": "5000"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "SensitiveDataDiscovery",
                "isEnabled": "True"
            }
        ],
        "subPlan": "DefenderForStorageV2",
        "pricingTier": "Standard"
    }
}
```

To modify the monthly threshold for malware scanning in your storage accounts, adjust the `CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount` parameter to your preferred value. This parameter sets a cap on the maximum data that can be scanned for malware each month, per storage account. If you want to permit unlimited scanning, assign the value -1. The default limit is set at 5,000 GB.

If you want to turn off the on-upload malware scanning or Sensitive data threat detection features, you can change the isEnabled value to **False** under Sensitive data discovery.

To disable the entire Defender plan, set the pricingTier property value to **Free** and remove the `subPlan` and extensions properties.

## [Enable on a storage account](#tab/enable-storage-account/)

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage at the storage account level using REST API, create a PUT request with this endpoint. Replace the `subscriptionId`, `resourceGroupName`, and `accountName` in the endpoint URL with your own Azure subscription ID, resource group and storage account names accordingly.

```rest
PUT
https://management.azure.com/{resourceId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings/current?api-version=2022-12-01-preview

```

And add the following request body:

```json
{
   "properties": {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "malwareScanning": {
            "onUpload": {
                "isEnabled": true,
                "capGBPerMonth": 5000
            },
   "scanResultsEventGridTopicResourceId": "/subscriptions/<Subscription>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/<topicName>"
        },
        "sensitiveDataDiscovery": {
            "isEnabled": true
        },
        "overrideSubscriptionLevelSettings": true
    },
    "scope": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('StorageAccountName'))]"
}
```

To modify the monthly threshold for malware scanning in your storage accounts, adjust the `capGBPerMonth` parameter to your preferred value. This parameter sets a cap on the maximum data that can be scanned for malware each month, per storage account. If you want to permit unlimited scanning, assign the value -1. The default limit is set at 5,000 GB.

If you want to turn off the on-upload malware scanning or sensitive data threat detection features, you can change the `isEnabled` value to **False** under the `malwareScanning` or `sensitiveDataDiscovery` properties sections.

To disable the entire Defender plan for the storage account, set the `isEnabled` property value to **False** and remove the `malwareScanning` and `sensitiveDataDiscovery` sections from the properties.
