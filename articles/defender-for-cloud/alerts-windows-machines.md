### **Detected suspicious use of Cacls to lower the security state of the system**

**Description**: Attackers use myriad ways like brute force, spear phishing etc. to achieve initial compromise and get a foothold on the network. Once initial compromise is achieved they often take steps to lower the security settings of a system. Caclsâ€”short for change access control list is Microsoft Windows native command-line utility often used for modifying the security permission on folders and files. A lot of time the binary is used by the attackers to lower the security settings of a system.

### **Suspicious download using Certutil detected [seen multiple times]**

**Description**: Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected the use of certutil.exe, a built-in administrator utility, for the download of a binary instead of its mainstream purpose that relates to manipulating certificates and certificate data. Attackers are known to abuse functionality of legitimate administrator tools to perform malicious actions, for example using certutil.exe to download and decode a malicious executable that will then be subsequently executed. This behavior was seen [x] times today on the following machines: [Machine names]

### **Suspicious WindowPosition registry value detected**

**Description**: Analysis of host data on %{Compromised Host} detected an attempted WindowPosition registry configuration change that could be indicative of hiding application windows in nonvisible sections of the desktop. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised machine: this type of activity has been previously associated with known adware (or unwanted software) such as Win32/OneSystemCare and Win32/SystemHealer and malware such as Win32/Creprote. When the WindowPosition value is set to 201329664, (Hex: 0x0c00 0c00, corresponding to X-axis=0c00 and the Y-axis=0c00) this places the console app's window in a non-visible section of the user's screen in an area that is hidden from view below the visible start menu/taskbar. Known suspect Hex value includes, but not limited to c000c000.
