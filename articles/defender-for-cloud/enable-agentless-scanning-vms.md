# Enable agentless scanning for VMs

Agentless scanning provides visibility into installed software and software vulnerabilities on your workloads to extend vulnerability assessment coverage to server workloads without a vulnerability assessment agent installed.

Agentless vulnerability assessment uses the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management engine to assess vulnerabilities in the software installed on your VMs, without requiring Defender for Endpoint to be installed. Vulnerability assessment shows software inventory and vulnerability results in the same format as the agent-based assessments.

## Compatibility with agent-based vulnerability assessment solutions

Defender for Cloud already supports different agent-based vulnerability scans, including [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM)](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management.md), [BYOL](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md). Agentless scanning extends the visibility of Defender for Cloud to reach more devices.

When you enable agentless vulnerability assessment:

- If you have **no existing integrated vulnerability** assessment solutions enabled on any of your VMs on your subscription, Defender for Cloud automatically enables MDVM by default.

- If you select **Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management** as part of an [integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md), Defender for Cloud shows a unified and consolidated view that optimizes coverage and freshness.

  - Machines covered by just one of the sources (Defender Vulnerability Management or agentless) show the results from that source.
  - Machines covered by both sources show the agent-based results only for increased freshness.

- If you select **Vulnerability assessment with BYOL integrations** - Defender for Cloud shows the agent-based results by default. Results from the agentless scan are shown for machines that don't have an agent installed or from machines that aren't reporting findings correctly.

    To change the default behavior to always display results from MDVM (regardless if a third-party agent solution), select the [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md#automatically-enable-a-vulnerability-assessment-solution) setting in the vulnerability assessment solution.

## Enabling agentless scanning for machines

When you enable [Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) or [Defender for Servers P2](defender-for-servers-introduction.md), agentless scanning is enabled on by default.

If you have Defender for Servers P2 already enabled and agentless scanning is turned off, you need to turn on agentless scanning manually.

You can enable agentless scanning on

- [Azure](#agentless-vulnerability-assessment-on-azure)
- [AWS](#agentless-vulnerability-assessment-on-aws)
- [GCP](#enable-agentless-scanning-in-gcp)

> [!NOTE]
> Agentless malware scanning is only available if you have [enabled Defender for Servers plan 2](tutorial-enable-servers-plan.md#select-a-defender-for-servers-plan)

### Agentless vulnerability assessment on Azure

**To enable agentless vulnerability assessment on Azure**:  

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open **Environment settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription.
1. For either the [Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) or Defender for Servers P2 plan, select **Settings**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/defender-plan-settings-azure.png" alt-text="Screenshot of link for the settings of the Defender plans for Azure accounts." lightbox="media/enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/defender-plan-settings-azure.png":::

    The agentless scanning settings are shared by both Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) or Defender for Servers P2. When you enable agentless scanning on either plan, the setting is enabled for both plans.

1. In the settings pane, turn on **Agentless scanning for machines**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/turn-on-agentless-scanning-azure.png" alt-text="Screenshot of settings and monitoring screen to turn on agentless scanning." lightbox="media/enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/turn-on-agentless-scanning-azure.png":::

1. Select **Save**.

**To enable scanning of CMK encrypted disks in Azure (preview)**:

For agentless scanning to cover Azure VMs with CMK encrypted disks, you need to grant Defender for Cloud additional permissions to create a secure copy of these disks. To do so, additional permissions are needed on Key Vaults used for CMK encryption for your VMs.

To manually assign the permissions, follow the below instructions according to your Key Vault type:

- For Key Vaults using non-RBAC permissions, assign "Microsoft Defender for Cloud Servers Scanner Resource Provider" (`0c7668b5-3260-4ad0-9f53-34ed54fa19b2`) these permissions: Key Get, Key Wrap, Key Unwrap.
- For Key Vaults using RBAC permissions, assign "Microsoft Defender for Cloud Servers Scanner Resource Provider” (`0c7668b5-3260-4ad0-9f53-34ed54fa19b2`) the [Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User](/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?preserve-view=true&tabs=azure-cli#azure-built-in-roles-for-key-vault-data-plane-operations) built-in role.

To assign these permissions at scale, you can also use [this script](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Powershell%20scripts/Agentless%20Scanning%20CMK%20support).

For more information, see [agentless scanning permissions](faq-permissions.yml#which-permissions-are-used-by-agentless-scanning-).

## Test the agentless malware scanner's deployment

Security alerts appear on the portal only in cases where threats are detected on your environment. If you do not have any alerts it might be because there are no threats on your environment. You can test to see that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to Defender for Cloud by creating a test file.

### Create a test file for Linux

1. Open a terminal window on the VM.

1. Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    # test string  
    TEST_STRING='$$89-barbados-dublin-damascus-notice-pulled-natural-31$$'  
     
    # File to be created  
    FILE_PATH="/tmp/virus_test_file.txt"  
     
    # Write the test string to the file  
    echo -n $TEST_STRING > $FILE_PATH  
     
    # Check if the file was created and contains the correct string  
    if [ -f "$FILE_PATH" ]; then  
        if grep -Fq "$TEST_STRING" "$FILE_PATH"; then  
            echo "Virus test file created and validated successfully."  
        else  
            echo "Virus test file does not contain the correct string."  
        fi  
    else  
        echo "Failed to create virus test file."  
    fi
    ```

The alert `MDC_Test_File malware was detected (Agentless)` will appear within 24 hours in the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and in the Defender XDR portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/enable-agentless-scanning-vms/test-alert.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the test alert that appears in Defender for Cloud for Linux." lightbox="media/enable-agentless-scanning-vms/test-alert.jpg":::

### Create a test file for Windows

#### Create a test file with a text document

1. Create a text file on your VM.

1. Paste the text `$$89-barbados-dublin-damascus-notice-pulled-natural-31$$` into the text file.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Ensure that there are no extra spaces or lines in the text file.

1. Save the file.

1. Open the file to validate that it contains the content from stage 2.

The alert `MDC_Test_File malware was detected (Agentless)` will appear within 24 hours in the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and in the Defender XDR portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/enable-agentless-scanning-vms/test-alert.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the test alert that appears in Defender for Cloud for Windows because of the text file that was created." lightbox="media/enable-agentless-scanning-vms/test-alert.jpg":::

#### Create a test file with PowerShell

1. Open PowerShell on your VM.

1. Execute the following script.

```powershell
# Virus test string
$TEST_STRING = '$$89-barbados-dublin-damascus-notice-pulled-natural-31$$'

# File to be created
$FILE_PATH = "C:\temp\virus_test_file.txt"

# Create "temp" directory if it does not exist
$DIR_PATH = "C:\temp"
if (!(Test-Path -Path $DIR_PATH)) {
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $DIR_PATH
}

# Write the test string to the file without a trailing newline
[IO.File]::WriteAllText($FILE_PATH, $TEST_STRING)

# Check if the file was created and contains the correct string
if (Test-Path -Path $FILE_PATH) {
    $content = [IO.File]::ReadAllText($FILE_PATH)
    if ($content -eq $TEST_STRING) {
      Write-Host "Test file created and validated successfully."
    } else {
       Write-Host "Test file does not contain the correct string."
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "Failed to create test file."
}
```

The alert `MDC_Test_File malware was detected (Agentless)` will appear within 24 hours in the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and in the Defender XDR portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/enable-agentless-scanning-vms/test-alert.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the test alert that appears in Defender for Cloud for Windows with because of the PowerShell script." lightbox="media/enable-agentless-scanning-vms/test-alert.jpg":::

## Exclude machines from scanning

Agentless scanning applies to all of the eligible machines in the subscription. To prevent specific machines from being scanned, you can exclude machines from agentless scanning based on your pre-existing environment tags. When Defender for Cloud performs the continuous discovery for machines, excluded machines are skipped.

**To configure machines for exclusion**:

1. In Defender for Cloud, select **Environment settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription or multicloud connector.
1. For either the Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) or Defender for Servers P2 plan, select **Settings**.
1. For agentless scanning, select **Edit configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-edit-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the link to edit the agentless scanning configuration." lightbox="media/enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-edit-configuration.png":::

1. Enter the tag name and value that applies to the machines that you want to exempt. You can enter `multiple tag:value` pairs.

    :::image type="content" source="media/enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-exclude-tags.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the tag and value fields for excluding machines from agentless scanning.":::

1. Select **Save**.
