  Move to vulnerability assessment with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
introduction: |

  Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides vulnerability scanning with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, to scan machines for software inventory and vulnerabilities, and provide findings and insights in Defender for Cloud. 
  If you're currently using a different vulnerability assessement solution, you can move to Defender Vulnerability Management using the instructions in this article. 

prerequisites:
  summary: |
    - Review [supported machines](/defender/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-supported-os)
    - Make sure you have a Defender for Servers plan enabled.
    - The plan must have Defender for Endpoint integration enabled.
    - You need Owner (resource group level) permissions to deploy.
    - You need Security Reader permissions to view vulnerability findings.

      Transition in the Azure portal 
    summary: |
      In the Azure portal, you have the ability to change the vulnerability assessment solution to the built-in Defender Vulnerability Management solution. 
    steps:
      - |
        Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
      - |
        Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**

      Transition with REST API
    summary: |
      ### REST API for Azure VMs

      Using this REST API, you can easily migrate your subscription, at scale, from any vulnerability assessment solution to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

      `PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessmentsSettings/AzureServersSetting?api-version=2022-01-01-preview`
    code: |
      ```json
      {
        "kind": "AzureServersSetting",
        "properties": {
          "selectedProvider": "MdeTvm"
        }
      }
      ```

      Once you complete the transition to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution, you need to [remove the old vulnerability assessment solution](#remove-the-old-vulnerability-assessment-solution).

      ### REST API for multicloud VMs

      Using this REST API, you can easily migrate your subscription, at scale, from any vulnerability assessment solution to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

      `PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/securityconnectors/{connectorName}?api-version=2022-08-01-preview`

      ## Remove the old vulnerability assessment solution
    
      After migrating to the built-in Defender Vulnerability Management solution in Defender for Cloud, offboard each VM from their old vulnerability assessment solution. To delete the VM extension, you can use the [Remove-AzVMExtension PowerShell cmdlet](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azvmextension) or a [REST API Delete request](/rest/api/compute/virtual-machine-extensions/delete?tabs=HTTP).
