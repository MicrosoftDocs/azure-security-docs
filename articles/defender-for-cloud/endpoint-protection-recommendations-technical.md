# Review and remediate endpoint detection and response recommendations (MMA)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides health assessments of [supported](supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-servers.md#endpoint-supported) versions of Endpoint protection solutions. This article explains the scenarios that lead Defender for Cloud to generate the following two recommendations:

- [Endpoint protection should be installed on your machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/4fb67663-9ab9-475d-b026-8c544cced439)
- [Endpoint protection health issues should be resolved on your machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/37a3689a-818e-4a0e-82ac-b1392b9bb000)

> [!NOTE]
> As the Log Analytics agent (also known as MMA) is set to retire in [August 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/were-retiring-the-log-analytics-agent-in-azure-monitor-on-31-august-2024/), all Defender for Servers features that currently depend on it, including those described on this page, will be available through either [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) or [agentless scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md), before the retirement date. For more information about the roadmap for each of the features that are currently rely on Log Analytics Agent, see [this announcement](upcoming-changes.md#defender-for-cloud-plan-and-strategy-for-the-log-analytics-agent-deprecation).

> [!TIP]
> At the end of 2021, we revised the recommendation that installs endpoint protection. One of the changes affects how the recommendation displays machines that are powered off. In the previous version, machines that were turned off appeared in the 'Not applicable' list. In the newer recommendation, they don't appear in any of the resources lists (healthy, unhealthy, or not applicable).

## Windows Defender
