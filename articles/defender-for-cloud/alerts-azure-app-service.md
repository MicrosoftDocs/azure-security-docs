# Alerts for Azure App Service

This article lists the security alerts you might get for Azure App Service from Microsoft Defender for Cloud and any Microsoft Defender plans you enabled. The alerts shown in your environment depend on the resources and services you're protecting, and your customized configuration.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the recently added alerts powered by Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint might be undocumented.

[Learn how to respond to these alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.md).

[Learn how to export alerts](continuous-export.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts from different sources might take different amounts of time to appear. For example, alerts that require analysis of network traffic might take longer to appear than alerts related to suspicious processes running on virtual machines.
> 
> In Microsoft Defender for App Services, alerts are generated no more than once per week for the same resource and alert type. This applies to all alert types, including EICAR test alerts.

## Azure App Service alerts

[Further details and notes](defender-for-app-service-introduction.md)

### **An attempt to run Linux commands on a Windows App Service**

(AppServices_LinuxCommandOnWindows)

**Description**: Analysis of App Service processes detected an attempt to run a Linux command on a Windows App Service. This action was running by the web application. This behavior is often seen during campaigns that exploit a vulnerability in a common web application.
(Applies to: App Service on Windows)

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: -

**Severity**: Medium

### **An IP that connected to your Azure App Service FTP Interface was found in Threat Intelligence**

(AppServices_IncomingTiClientIpFtp)

**Description**: Azure App Service FTP log indicates a connection from a source address that was found in the threat intelligence feed. During this connection, a user accessed the pages listed.
(Applies to: App Service on Windows and App Service on Linux)

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Initial Access

**Severity**: Medium

### **Attempt to run high privilege command detected**

(AppServices_HighPrivilegeCommand)

**Description**: Analysis of App Service processes detected an attempt to run a command that requires high privileges.
The command ran in the web application context. While this behavior can be legitimate, in web applications this behavior is also observed in malicious activities.
(Applies to: App Service on Windows)

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: -

**Severity**: Medium

### **Communication with suspicious domain identified by threat intelligence**

(AzureDNS_ThreatIntelSuspectDomain)

**Description**: Communication with suspicious domain was detected by analyzing DNS transactions from your resource and comparing against known malicious domains identified by threat intelligence feeds. Communication to malicious domains is frequently performed by attackers and could imply that your resource is compromised.

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Initial Access, Persistence, Execution, Command And Control, Exploitation

**Severity**: Medium

### **Connection to web page from anomalous IP address detected**

(AppServices_AnomalousPageAccess)

**Description**: Azure App Service activity log indicates an anomalous connection to a sensitive web page from the listed source IP address. This might indicate that someone is attempting a brute force attack into your web app administration pages. It might also be the result of a new IP address being used by a legitimate user. If the source IP address is trusted, you can safely suppress this alert for this resource. To learn how to suppress security alerts, see [Suppress alerts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud](alerts-suppression-rules.md).
(Applies to: App Service on Windows and App Service on Linux)

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Initial Access

**Severity**: Low

### **Dangling DNS record for an App Service resource detected**

(AppServices_DanglingDomain)

**Description**: A DNS record that points to a recently deleted App Service resource (also known as "dangling DNS" entry) has been detected. This leaves you susceptible to a subdomain takeover. Subdomain takeovers enable malicious actors to redirect traffic intended for an organization's domain to a site performing malicious activity.
(Applies to: App Service on Windows and App Service on Linux)

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: -

**Severity**: High

### **Detected encoded executable in command line data**

(AppServices_Base64EncodedExecutableInCommandLineParams)

**Description**: Analysis of host data on {Compromised host} detected a base-64 encoded executable. This has previously been associated with attackers attempting to construct executables on-the-fly through a sequence of commands, and attempting to evade intrusion detection systems by ensuring that no individual command would trigger an alert. This could be legitimate activity, or an indication of a compromised host.
(Applies to: App Service on Windows)

### **Executable decoded using certutil**

(AppServices_ExecutableDecodedUsingCertutil)

**Description**: Analysis of host data on [Compromised entity] detected that certutil.exe, a built-in administrator utility, was being used to decode an executable instead of its mainstream purpose that relates to manipulating certificates and certificate data. Attackers are known to abuse functionality of legitimate administrator tools to perform malicious actions, for example using a tool such as certutil.exe to decode a malicious executable that will then be subsequently executed.
(Applies to: App Service on Windows)

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Collection

**Severity**: High

### **PHP file in upload folder**

(AppServices_PhpInUploadFolder)

**Description**: Azure App Service activity log indicates an access to a suspicious PHP page located in the upload folder.
This type of folder doesn't usually contain PHP files. The existence of this type of file might indicate an exploitation taking advantage of arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities.
(Applies to: App Service on Windows and App Service on Linux)

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Execution

**Severity**: Medium

### **Possible Cryptocoinminer download detected**

(Applies to: App Service on Linux)

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Collection, Exfiltration

**Severity**: Medium

### **Potential dangling DNS record for an App Service resource detected**

(AppServices_PotentialDanglingDomain)

**Description**: A DNS record that points to a recently deleted App Service resource (also known as "dangling DNS" entry) has been detected. This might leave you susceptible to a subdomain takeover. Subdomain takeovers enable malicious actors to redirect traffic intended for an organization's domain to a site performing malicious activity. In this case, a text record with the Domain Verification ID was found. Such text records prevent subdomain takeover but we still recommend removing the dangling domain. If you leave the DNS record pointing at the subdomain you're at risk if anyone in your organization deletes the TXT file or record in the future.

**Severity**: Medium

### **Raw data download detected**

(AppServices_DownloadCodeFromWebsite)

**Description**: Analysis of App Service processes detected an attempt to download code from raw-data websites such as Pastebin. This action was run by a PHP process. This behavior is associated with attempts to download web shells or other malicious components to the App Service.
