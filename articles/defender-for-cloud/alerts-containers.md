# Alerts for containers - Kubernetes clusters

This article lists the security alerts you might get for containers and Kubernetes clusters from Microsoft Defender for Cloud and any Microsoft Defender plans you enabled. The alerts shown in your environment depend on the resources and services you're protecting, and your customized configuration.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the recently added alerts powered by Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint might be undocumented.

[Learn how to respond to these alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.yml).

[Learn how to export alerts](continuous-export.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts from different sources might take different amounts of time to appear. For example, alerts that require analysis of network traffic might take longer to appear than alerts related to suspicious processes running on virtual machines.

## Alerts for containers and Kubernetes clusters

Microsoft Defender for Containers provides security alerts on the cluster level and on the underlying cluster nodes by monitoring both control plane (API server) and the containerized workload itself. Control plane security alerts can be recognized by a prefix of `K8S_` of the alert type. Security alerts for runtime workload in the clusters can be recognized by the `K8S.NODE_` prefix of the alert type. All alerts are supported on Linux only, unless otherwise indicated.
