# Analyze recommendations with Microsoft Security Copilot

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's integration with Microsoft Security Copilot allows you to analyze all of the recommendations presented on the recommendations page. By narrowing the scope of the recommendations page, you can focus on specific recommendations and get a better understanding of your security posture.

Once the list of recommendations is filtered, you can investigate specific recommendations and gain a better understanding of the risks and vulnerabilities that are present in your environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Enable Defender for Cloud on your environment](connect-azure-subscription.md).

- [Have access to Azure Copilot](/azure/copilot/overview).
