        answer: |
          When Defender for Servers Plan 2 is enabled you get a free data ingestion allowance for specific data types. [Learn more](data-ingestion-benefit.md)

  - name: Deployment
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I enable Defender for Servers on a subset of machines in a subscription?
        answer: |
          Yes you can enable Defender for Servers on specific resources in a subscription. Learn more about [planning deployment scope](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md).

      - question: |
          How does Defender for Servers collect data?
        answer: |
          Learn about [data collection methods in Defender for Servers](plan-defender-for-servers-agents.md).

      - question: |
          Where does Defender for Servers store my data?
        answer: |
          Learn about [data residency for Defender for Cloud](plan-defender-for-servers-data-workspace.md). 

      - question: |
          Does Defender for Servers need a Log Analytics workspace?
        answer: |
          Defender for Servers Plan 1 doesn't depend on Log Analytics. In Defender for Servers Plan 2, you need a Log Analytics workspace to take advantage of the [free data ingestion benefit](data-ingestion-benefit.md). You also need a workspace to use [file integrity monitoring](file-integrity-monitoring-overview.md) in Plan 2.
          If you do set up a Log Analytics workspace for the free data ingestion benefit, you need to [enable Defender for Servers Plan 2](data-ingestion-benefit.md#configure-a-workspace) directly on it.

      - question: |
          What if I have Defender for Servers enabled on a workspace but not on a subscription?
        answer: |
          The [legacy method for onboarding servers to Defender for Servers Plan 2](quickstart-onboard-machines.md) using a workspace and the Log Analytics agent is no longer supported or available in the portal. To ensure that machines that are currently connected to the workspace remain protected, do the following:

          - **On-premises and multicloud machines**: If you previously onboarded on-premises and AWS/GCP machines using the legacy method, [connect these machines to Azure](/azure/azure-arc/servers/deployment-options) as Azure Arc-enabled servers to the subscription with Defender for Servers Plan 2 enabled.
          - **Selected machines**: If you used the legacy method to enable Defender for Servers Plan 2 on individual machines, we recommend that you enable Defender for Server Plan 2 on the entire subscription. Then you can exclude specific machines using [resource-level configuration](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md).

      - question: |
          Does disabling Defender for Servers Plan 2 automatically remove the service from my workspace?
        answer: |
          Disabling Defender for Servers Plan 2 doesn't automatically remove the service from your workspace.  If you've enabled Plan 2 on a workspace, you need to manually remove the workspace configuration to stop data collection and fully turn off the feature.
  
  - name: Defender for Endpoint integration
    questions:
      - question: |
          Which Microsoft Defender for Endpoint plan is supported in Defender for Servers?
        answer: |
          Defender for Servers Plan 1 and Plan 2 provides the capabilities of [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint), including endpoint detection and response (EDR).
  
      - question: |
          Do I need to buy a separate anti-malware solution for my machines?
        answer: |
          No.  With Defender for Endpoint integration in Defender for Servers, you'll also get malware protection on your machines. In addition, Defender for Servers Plan 2 provides [agentless malware scanning](agentless-malware-scanning.md).

          On new Windows Server operating systems, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is part of the operating system and will be enabled in *active mode*. For machines running Windows Server with the Defender for Endpoint unified solution integration enabled, Defender for Servers deploys [Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows) in *active mode*. On Linux, Defender for Servers deploys Defender for Endpoint including the anti-malware component, and set the component in *passive mode*.
                      
      - question: |
          How do I switch from a non-Microsoft EDR tool?
        answer: |
          Full instructions for switching from a non-Microsoft endpoint solution are available in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint documentation: [Migration overview](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/switch-to-microsoft-defender-migration).

      - question: |
          What's the "MDE.Windows" / "MDE.Linux" extension running on my machines?
        answer: |
          When you turn on the Defender for Servers plan in a subscription, the native Defender for Endpoint integration in Defender for Cloud automatically deploys the Defender for Endpoint agent on supported machines in the subscription as needed. Automatic onboarding installs the MDE.Windows/MDE.Linux extension.

          If the extension isn't showing, check that the machine meets the [prerequisites](enable-defender-for-endpoint.md#prerequisites), and that Defender for Servers is enabled.

          > [!IMPORTANT]
          > If you delete the **MDE.Windows**/**MDE.Linux** extension, it won't remove Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Learn about [offboard Windows servers from Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints#offboard-windows-servers).

  - name: Machine support and scanning
    questions:
      - question: |
          What types of virtual machines do Defender for Servers support?
        answer: |
          Review [Windows](support-matrix-defender-for-servers.md#windows-machine-support) and [Linux](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux) machines that are supported for Defender for Endpoint integration.
        
      - question: |
          How often does Defender for Cloud scan for operating system vulnerabilities, system updates, and endpoint protection issues?
        answer: |
          System updates interpretation occurs every 12 hours and every 24 hours for agentless endpoint protection platform.
 
          Defender for Cloud typically scans for new data every hour, and refreshes security recommendations accordingly.

      - question: |
          What is endpoint protection platform (EPP)?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Defender for Servers, EPP refers to the core set of security capabilities that protect endpoints (like servers) from threats. These capabilities are typically delivered through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

          When you enable Microsoft Defender for Servers, it integrates with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to provide EPP capabilities. This integration allows Defender for Cloud to access data about vulnerabilities, installed software, and alerts from your endpoints.
      
      - question: |
          How are VM snapshots collected by agentless scanning secured?
        answer: |
          Agentless scanning protects disk snapshots according to Microsoft's highest security standards. Security measures include:

          - Data is encrypted at rest and in-transit.
          - Snapshots are immediately deleted when the analysis process is complete.
          - Snapshots remain within their original AWS or Azure region. EC2 snapshots aren't copied to Azure.
          - Isolation of environments per customer account/subscription.
          - Only metadata containing scan results is sent outside the isolated scanning environment.
          - All operations are audited.

      - question: |
          What is the auto-provisioning feature for vulnerability scanning with a "bring your own license" (BYOL) solution? Can it be applied on multiple solutions?
        answer: |
          Defender for Servers can scan machines to see if they have an EDR solution enabled. If they don't, you can use Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management that's integrated by default into Defender for Cloud. As an alternative, Defender for Cloud can deploy a supported non-Microsoft BYOL vulnerability scanner. You can only use a single BYOL scanner. Multiple non-Microsoft scanners aren't supported.

      - question: | 
          Does the integrated Defender for Vulnerability Management scanner find network vulnerabilities?
        answer: | 
          No, it only finds vulnerabilities on the machine itself.

      - question: |
          Why do I get the message "Missing scan data" for my VM?
        answer: |
          This message appears when there's no scan data for a VM. It takes around an hour or less to scan data after a data collection method is enabled. After the initial scan, you might receive this message because there's no scan data available. For example, scans don't populate for a VM that's stopped. This message might also appear if scan data hasn't populated recently.

      - question: |
          Why is a machine shown as not applicable?
        answer: |
          The list of resources in the **Not applicable** tab includes a **Reason** column

          | Reason                                                            | Details                                                                                                                                                                        |
