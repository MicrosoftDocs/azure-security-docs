      - question: |
         How can I view vulnerability assessment findings generated by Defender Vulnerability Management focusing on CVE ID?
        answer: |
         You can use the [CVE workbook](https://aka.ms/CVEDashboard) covering both the built-in Qualys VA solution and the built-in MDVM solution. The CVE workbook provides an overview of machines in your environment with open vulnerabilities focusing on CVE IDs. It shows vulnerability findings for either Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management or the integrated Qualys VA scanner.


      - question: |
          Which operating systems are compatible with Defender Vulnerability Management scanning?
        answer: |
          Review [compatible operating systems](/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-supported-os) for the MDVM scanner.

          If your machine's operating system isn't on the list, it isn't supported for scanning.

      - question: |
          Which agent does Defender Vulnerability Management scanning use?
        answer: |
          The scanner uses the same agent as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If endpoint protection is enabled, Defender Vulnerability Management is enabled.


      - question: |
          If I use an EDR solution other than Defender for Endpoint, how can I scan Defender Vulnerability Management?
        answer: |
          For cloud VMs, use agentless scanning in Defender for Servers Plan 2 to provide comprehensive coverage with minimal effect on machine performance.

          For on-premises machines, install the [Defender for Endpoint agent must be installed](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints) for vulnerability scanning.


      - question: |
          How can I use premium Defender Vulnerability Management capabilities?
        answer: |
          Premium capabilities are available in the [Defender Vulnerability Management portal](https://security.microsoft.com/). Navigate to the [MDVM portal](https://security.microsoft.com/), and access the premium capabilities features under the vulnerability assessment section.
