    questions:
    
      - question: |
         How can I view vulnerability assessment findings generated by Defender Vulnerability Management with a focus on CVE ID?
        answer: |
         You can use the [CVE workbook](https://aka.ms/CVEDashboard) which covers both the built-in Qualys VA solution and the built-in MDVM solution. The CVE workbook provides an overview of machines in your environment that have open vulnerabilities with a focus on CVE IDs. It shows vulnerability findings for either Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, or the integrated Qualys VA scanner.


      - question: |
          What operating systems are compatible with the Defender Vulnerability Management scanning? 
        answer: |
          Review [compatible operating systems](/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-supported-os) that are compatible with the MDVM scanner.

          If your machine's operating system isn't on the list, it isn't supported for scanning.


      - question: |
          Which agent is being used by the Defender Vulnerability Management scanning?
        answer: |
          The scanner uses the same agent as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If endpoint protection is enabled, Defender Vulnerability Management is enabled.


      - question: |
          If I'm using an EDR solution other than Defender for Endpoint, how can I scan Defender Vulnerability Management
        answer: |
          For cloud VMs, we recommend using agentless scanning in Defender for Servers Plan 2, to provide comprehensive coverage with minimal effect on machine performance.

          For on-premises machines, the [Defender for Endpoint agent must be installed](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints) for vulnerability scanning.


      - question: |
          How can I use premium Defender Vulnerability Management premium capabilities?
        answer: |
          Premium capabilities are available in the [Defender Vulnerability Management portal](https://security.microsoft.com/). Navigate to the [MDVM portal](https://security.microsoft.com/), and access the premium capabilities features under the vulnerability assessment section.
