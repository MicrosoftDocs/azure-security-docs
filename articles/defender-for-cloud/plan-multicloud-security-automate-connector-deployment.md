# Automate connector deployment

This article is part of a series to guide you in designing a solution for cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud workload protection (CWP) across multicloud resources with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

## Goal

Connect AWS accounts and/or GCP projects programmatically.

## Get started

As an alternative to creating connectors in the Defender for Cloud portal, you can create them programmatically by using the Defender for Cloud REST API.
Review the [Security Connectors - REST API](/rest/api/defenderforcloud-composite/security-connectors?view=rest-defenderforcloud-composite-latest&preserve-view=true).

- When you use REST API to create the connector, you also need the CloudFormation template, or Cloud Shell script, depending on the environment that you’re onboarding to Defender for Cloud.
- The easiest way to get this script is to download it from the Defender for Cloud portal.
- The template/script changes depending on the plans you’re enabling.
