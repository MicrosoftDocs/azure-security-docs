### General availability of enhanced discovery and configuration recommendations for endpoint protection

July 31, 2024

Improved discovery features for endpoint protection solutions and enhanced identification of configuration issues are now GA and available for multicloud servers. These updates are included in the Defender for Servers Plan 2 and Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM).  

The enhanced recommendations feature uses [agentless machine scanning](/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-agentless-data-collection), enabling comprehensive discovery and assessment of the configuration of [supported endpoint detection and response solutions](/azure/defender-for-cloud/endpoint-detection-response). When configuration issues are identified, remediation steps are provided.  

With this general availability release, the list of [supported solutions](/azure/defender-for-cloud/endpoint-detection-response) is expanded to include two more endpoint detection and response tools:  

- Singularity Platform by SentinelOne  
- Cortex XDR

### Adaptive network hardening deprecation

July 31, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: August 31, 2024

Defender for Server's adaptive network hardening is being deprecated.

The feature deprecation includes the following experiences:

- **Recommendation**: [Adaptive network hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines](recommendations-reference-networking.md#adaptive-network-hardening-recommendations-should-be-applied-on-internet-facing-virtual-machines) [assessment Key: f9f0eed0-f143-47bf-b856-671ea2eeed62]
- **Alert**: [Traffic detected from IP addresses recommended for blocking](alerts-azure-network-layer.md#traffic-detected-from-ip-addresses-recommended-for-blocking)

### Preview: Security assessments for GitHub no longer require additional licensing

July 22, 2024

GitHub users in Defender for Cloud no longer need a GitHub Advanced Security license to view security findings. This applies to security assessments for code weaknesses, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities in container images that are detected during the build phase.

Customers with GitHub Advanced Security will continue to receive additional security assessments in Defender for Cloud for exposed credentials, vulnerabilities in open source dependencies, and CodeQL findings.

To learn more about DevOps security in Defender for Cloud, see the [DevOps Security Overview](defender-for-devops-introduction.md). To learn how to onboard your GitHub environment to Defender for Cloud, follow the [GitHub onboarding guide](quickstart-onboard-github.md). To learn how to configure the Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub Action, see our [GitHub Action](github-action.md) documentation.

### Updated timelines toward MMA deprecation in Defender for Servers Plan 2

July 18, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: August 2024

With the [upcoming deprecation of Log Analytics agent in August](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/microsoft-defender-for-cloud-strategy-and-plan-towards-log/ba-p/3883341), all security value for server protection in Defender for Cloud will rely on integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) as a single agent and on agentless capabilities provided by the cloud platform and agentless machine scanning.

The following capabilities have updated timelines and plans, thus the support for them over MMA will be extended for Defender for Cloud customers to the end of November 2024:

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Public preview release for FIM new version over MDE is planned for **August 2024**. The GA version of FIM powered by Log Analytics agent will continue to be supported for existing customers until the end of **November 2024**.

- **Security Baseline:** as an alternative to the version based on MMA, the current preview version based on Guest Configuration will be released to general availability in **September 2024.** OS Security Baselines powered by Log Analytics agent will continue to be supported for existing customers until the end of **November 2024.**

For more information, see [Prepare for retirement of the Log Analytics agent](prepare-deprecation-log-analytics-mma-agent.md).

### Deprecation of MMA-related features as part of agent retirement

July 18, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: August 2024

As part of the [deprecation of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and the updated Defender for Servers deployment strategy](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/microsoft-defender-for-cloud-strategy-and-plan-towards-log/ba-p/3883341), all security features for Defender for Servers will now be provided through a single agent (Defender for Endpoint), or via agentless scanning capabilities. This won't require dependence on either the MMA or Azure Monitoring Agent (AMA).

As we approach the agent's retirement in August 2024, the following MMA-related features will be removed from the Defender for Cloud portal:

- Display of MMA installation status on the **Inventory** and **Resource Health** blades.
- [The capability](quickstart-onboard-machines.md#connect-on-premises-machines-by-using-the-azure-portal) to onboard new non-Azure servers to Defender for Servers via Log Analytics workspaces will be removed from both the **Inventory** and **Getting Started** blades.  

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that current customers, who have onboarded on-premises servers using the [legacy approach](quickstart-onboard-machines.md#connect-on-premises-machines-by-using-the-azure-portal), should now connect these machines via Azure Arc-enabled servers.  We  also recommend enabling the Defender for Servers Plan 2 on the Azure subscriptions to which these servers are connected.
>
>For those customers who have selectively enabled Defender for Servers Plan 2 on specific Azure VMs through the [legacy approach](quickstart-onboard-machines.md#connect-on-premises-machines-by-using-the-azure-portal), we recommend enabling the Defender for Servers Plan 2 on the Azure subscriptions of these machines. You can then exclude individual machines from the Defender for Servers coverage using the Defender for Servers [per-resource configuration](tutorial-enable-servers-plan.md#enable-defender-for-servers-at-the-resource-level).
>
> These steps will ensure there is no loss of security coverage due to the retirement of the Log Analytics agent.

To maintain security continuity, we advise customers with Defender for Servers Plan 2 to enable [agentless machine scanning](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md) and [integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](enable-defender-for-endpoint.md) on their subscriptions.

You can use [this custom workbook](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Workbooks/Defender%20for%20Servers%20Deployment%20Status) to keep track of your Log Analytics Agent (MMA) estate and monitor the deployment status of Defender for Servers across Azure VMs and Azure Arc machines.

For more information, see [Prepare for retirement of the Log Analytics agent](prepare-deprecation-log-analytics-mma-agent.md).

### Binary Drift public preview now available in Defender for Containers

We are introducing the public preview of Binary Drift for Defender for Containers. This feature aids in identifying and mitigating potential security risks associated with unauthorized binaries in your containers. Binary Drift autonomously identifies and sends alerts about potentially harmful binary processes within your containers. Furthermore, it allows the implementation of a new Binary Drift Policy to control alert preferences, offering the ability to tailor notifications to specific security needs.
For more information about this feature, see [Binary Drift Detection](binary-drift-detection.md)

### Automated remediation scripts for AWS and GCP are now GA

July 14, 2024

In March, we released automated remediation scripts for AWS & GCP to Public Preview, that allows you to remediate recommendations for AWS & GCP at scale programmatically.

Today we are releasing this feature to  generally available (GA). [Learn how to use automated remediation scripts](/azure/defender-for-cloud/implement-security-recommendations)>

### GitHub application permissions update

July 11, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: July 18, 2024

DevOps security in Defender for Cloud is constantly making updates that require customers with GitHub connectors in Defender for Cloud to update the permissions for the Microsoft Security DevOps application in GitHub.

As part of this update, the GitHub application will require GitHub Copilot Business read permissions. This permission will be used to help customers better secure their GitHub Copilot deployments. We suggest updating the application as soon as possible.

Permissions can be granted in two different ways:

1. In your GitHub organization, navigate to the Microsoft Security DevOps application within **Settings > GitHub Apps** and accept the permissions request.

1. In an automated email from GitHub Support, select **Review permission request** to accept or reject this change.

### Compliance standards are now GA

July 10, 2024

In March, we added preview versions of many new compliance standards for customers to validate their AWS and GCP resources against.

Those standards included CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Benchmark, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002, CRI Profile, CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), Brazilian General Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and more.

Those preview standards are now generally available (GA).

Check out the [full list of supported compliance standards](concept-regulatory-compliance-standards.md#available-compliance-standards).

### Inventory experience improvement

July 9, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: July 11, 2024

The inventory experience will be updated to improve performance, including improvements to the blade's 'Open query' query logic in Azure Resource Graph. Updates to the logic behind Azure resource calculation may result in additional resources counted and presented.

### Container mapping tool to run by default in GitHub

July 8, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: August 12, 2024

With DevOps security capabilities in Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), you can map your cloud-native applications from code to cloud to easily kick off developer remediation workflows and reduce the time to remediation of vulnerabilities in your container images. Currently, you must manually configure the container image mapping tool to run in the Microsoft Security DevOps action in GitHub. With this change, container mapping will run by default as part of the Microsoft Security DevOps action. [Learn more about the Microsoft Security DevOps action](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action/blob/main/README.md#advanced).

Since Defender for Containers in multicloud is now generally available, it's no longer free of charge. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).

### Deprecation: Reminder of deprecation for adaptive recommendations

June 20, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: August, 2024

As part of the [MMA deprecation and the Defender for Servers updated deployment strategy](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/microsoft-defender-for-cloud-strategy-and-plan-towards-log/ba-p/3883341), Defender for Servers security features will be provided through the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) agent, or through the [agentless scanning capabilities](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md). Both of these options won't depend on either the MMA or Azure Monitoring Agent (AMA).

Adaptive Security Recommendations, known as Adaptive Application Controls and Adaptive Network Hardening, will be discontinued. The current GA version based on the MMA and the preview version based on the AMA will be deprecated in August 2024.

### Preview: Copilot for Security in Defender for Cloud

June 10, 2024

We're announcing the integration of Microsoft Copilot for Security into Defender for Cloud in public preview. Copilot's embedded experience in Defender for Cloud provides users with the ability to ask questions and get answers in natural language. Copilot can help you understand the context of a recommendation, the effect of implementing a recommendation, the steps needed to take to implement a recommendation, assist with the delegation of recommendations, and assist with the remediation of misconfigurations in code.

Learn more about [Copilot for Security in Defender for Cloud](copilot-security-in-defender-for-cloud.md).

### Update: SQL vulnerability assessment automatic enablement

June 10, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: July 10, 2024

Originally, SQL Vulnerability Assessment (VA) with Express Configuration was only automatically enabled on servers where Microsoft Defender for SQL was activated after the introduction of Express Configuration in December 2022.

We will be updating all Azure SQL Servers that had Microsoft Defender for SQL activated before December 2022 and had no existing SQL VA policy in place, to have SQL Vulnerability Assessment (SQL VA) automatically enabled with Express Configuration.

- The implementation of this change will be gradual, spanning several weeks, and does not require any action on the user’s part.
- This change applies to Azure SQL Servers where Microsoft Defender for SQL was activated at the Azure subscription level.
- Servers with an existing classic configuration (whether valid or invalid) will not be affected by this change.
- Upon activation, the recommendation ‘SQL databases should have vulnerability findings resolved’ may appear and could potentially impact your secure score.

### Update: Changes in identity recommendations behavior

June 3, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: July 2024

These changes:

- The assessed resource will become the identity instead of the subscription
- The recommendations won't have 'sub-recommendations' anymore
- The value of the 'assessmentKey' field in the API will be changed for those recommendations

Will be applied to the following recommendations:

- Accounts with owner permissions on Azure resources should be MFA enabled
- Accounts with write permissions on Azure resources should be MFA enabled
- Accounts with read permissions on Azure resources should be MFA enabled
- Guest accounts with owner permissions on Azure resources should be removed
- Guest accounts with write permissions on Azure resources should be removed
- Guest accounts with read permissions on Azure resources should be removed
- Blocked accounts with owner permissions on Azure resources should be removed
- Blocked accounts with read and write permissions on Azure resources should be removed
- A maximum of 3 owners should be designated for your subscription
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription

### GA: Windows container images scanning

March 31, 2024

We're announcing the general availability (GA) of the Windows container images support for scanning by Defender for Containers.

### Update: Continuous export now includes attack path data

March 25, 2024

We're announcing that continuous export now includes attack path data. This feature allows you to stream security data to Log Analytics in Azure Monitor, to Azure Event Hubs, or to another Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration Automated Response (SOAR), or IT classic deployment model solution.

### Preview: Agentless scanning supports CMK encrypted VMs in Azure

March 21, 2024

Until now agentless scanning covered CMK encrypted VMs in AWS and GCP. With this release, we're completing support for Azure as well. The capability employs a unique scanning approach for CMK in Azure:

- Defender for Cloud doesn't handle the key or decryption process. Keys and decryption are seamlessly handled by Azure Compute and is transparent to Defender for Cloud's agentless scanning service.
- The unencrypted VM disk data is never copied or re-encrypted with another key.
- The original key isn't replicated during the process. Purging it eradicates the data on both your production VM and Defender for Cloud’s temporary snapshot.

During public preview this capability isn't automatically enabled. If you're using Defender for Servers P2 or Defender CSPM and your environment has VMs with CMK encrypted disks, you can now have them scanned for vulnerabilities, secrets, and malware following these [enablement steps](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#agentless-vulnerability-assessment-on-azure).

March 13, 2024

Today, we are announcing that you can now monitor your DevOps security and compliance posture in the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](concept-regulatory-compliance.md) (MCSB) in addition to Azure, AWS, and GCP. DevOps assessments are part of the DevOps Security control in the MCSB.

The MCSB is a framework that defines fundamental cloud security principles based on common industry standards and compliance frameworks. MCSB provides prescriptive details for how to implement its cloud-agnostic security recommendations.

Learn more about the [DevOps recommendations](recommendations-reference-devops.md) that will be included and the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](concept-regulatory-compliance.md).

### Update: Decommissioning of Microsoft.SecurityDevOps resource provider

February 5, 2024

**Estimated date for change**: March 6, 2024

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is decommissioning the resource provider `Microsoft.SecurityDevOps` that was used during public preview of DevOps security, having migrated to the existing `Microsoft.Security` provider. The reason for the change is to improve customer experiences by reducing the number of resource providers associated with DevOps connectors.

Customers that are still using the API version **2022-09-01-preview** under `Microsoft.SecurityDevOps` to query Defender for Cloud DevOps security data will be impacted. To avoid disruption to their service, customer will need to update to the new API version **2023-09-01-preview** under the `Microsoft.Security` provider.

Customers currently using Defender for Cloud DevOps security from Azure portal won't be impacted.

For details on the new API version, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud REST APIs](/rest/api/defenderforcloud/operation-groups).
