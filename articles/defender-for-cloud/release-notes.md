### Enhanced container protection with vulnerability assessment and malware detection for AKS nodes is now GA
 
March 30, 2025
 
Defender for Cloud now provides vulnerability assessment and malware detection for the nodes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as GA.
Providing security protection for these Kubernetes nodes allow customers to maintain security and compliance across the managed Kubernetes service, as well as understand their part in the shared security responsibility they have with the managed cloud provider.
To receive the new capabilities, you have to enable the **Agentless scanning for machines**"** as part of Defender CSPM, Defender for Containers, or Defender for Servers P2 plan on your subscription.

#### Vulnerability Assessment

A new recommendation is now available in Azure portal: **AKS nodes should have vulnerability findings resolved.** Using this recommendation, you can now review and remediate vulnerabilities and CVEs found on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes.

#### Malware detection

New security alerts are triggered when the agentless malware detection capability detects malware in AKS nodes.
Agentless malware detection uses the Microsoft Defender Antivirus anti-malware engine to scan and detect malicious files. When threats are detected, security alerts are directed into Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR, where they can be investigated and remediated.
 
**Note:** Malware detection for AKS nodes is available only for Defender for Containers or Defender for Servers P2 enabled environments.

### Kubernetes gated deployment (Preview)

March 27, 2025

We're introducing the Kubernetes gated deployment (Preview) feature to the Defender for Containers plan. Kubernetes gated deployment is a mechanism for enhancing Kubernetes security by controlling the deployment of container images that violate organizational security policies. 

This capability is based on two new functionalities: 

- **Vulnerability findings artifact**: Generation of findings for each container image scanned for vulnerability assessment.
- **Security rules**: Addition of security rules to alert or prevent the deployment of vulnerable container images into Kubernetes clusters. 

**Customized security rules**: Customers can customize security rules for various environments, for Kubernetes clusters within their organization, or for namespaces, to enable security controls tailored to specific needs and compliance requirements.

**Configurable actions for a security rule**:

- **Audit**: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers an "Audit" action, generating a recommendation with violation details on the container image. 

- **Deny**: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers a "Deny" action to prevent deployment of the container image, ensuring that only secure and compliant images are deployed. 

**End-to-End Security**: Defining protection from deployment of vulnerable container images as the first security rule, we introduce the end-to-end Kubernetes secure gating mechanism, ensuring that vulnerable containers don't enter the customer's Kubernetes environment. 

For more information about this feature, seeâ€¯[Gated Deployment solution overview](gated-deployment-introduction.md).

### Customizable on-upload malware scanning filters in Defender for Storage (Preview)

March 27, 2025

On-upload malware scanning now supports customizable filters. Users can set exclusion rules for on-upload malware scans based on blob path prefixes, suffixes as well as by blob size. By excluding specific blob paths and types, such as logs or temporary files, you can avoid unnecessary scans and reduce costs.

Learn how to [configure customizable on-upload malware scanning filters](on-upload-malware-scanning.md#customizable-on-upload-malware-scanning-filters).

### General Availability for agentless VM scanning support for CMK in Azure

March 26, 2025

Agentless scanning for Azure VMs with CMK encrypted disks is now Generally Available. Both the Defender CSPM plan, and the Defender for Servers P2 provide support for agentless scanning for VMs, now with CMK support across all clouds

Learn how to [enable agentless scanning for Azure VMs with CMK encrypted disks](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#enable-for-azure-vms-with-cmk-encrypted-disks).

### Upcoming change to the recommendation severity levels

March 11, 2025

We're enhancing the severity levels of recommendations to improve risk assessment and prioritization. As part of this update, we reevaluated all severity classifications and introduced a new level â€” Critical. Previously, recommendations were categorized into three levels: Low, Medium, and High. With this update, there are now four distinct levels: Low, Medium, High, and Critical, providing a more granular risk evaluation to help customers focus on the most urgent security issues.

As a result, customers might notice changes in the severity of existing recommendations. Additionally, the risk level evaluation, which is available for Defender CSPM customers only, might also be affected as both recommendation severity and asset context are taken into consideration. These adjustments could affect the overall risk level.

**The projected change will take place on March 25, 2025.**

### General Availability of File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) based on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in Azure Government 

March 03, 2025

File Integrity Monitoring based on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now GA in Azure Government (GCCH) as part of Defender for Servers Plan 2. 
- Meet compliance requirements by monitoring critical files and registries in real-time and auditing the changes.
- Identify potential security issues by detecting suspicious file content changes.

This improved FIM experience replaces the existing one that set for deprecation with the Log Analytics Agent (MMA) retirement. The [FIM experience over MMA](/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-enable-log-analytics) will remain supported in Azure Government until the end of March 2023.

With this release, an in-product experience will be released to allow you to migrate your FIM configuration over MMA to the new FIM over Defender for Endpoint version.

For information on how to enable FIM over Defender for Endpoint, see [File Integrity Monitoring using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-enable-defender-endpoint). For information on how to disable previous versions and use the migration tool, see [Migrate File Integrity Monitoring from previous versions](/azure/defender-for-cloud/migrate-file-integrity-monitoring).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The availability of File Integrity Monitoring in Azure China 21Vianet and in GCCM clouds is not currently planned to be supported.

### Improved AWS EC2 Resource Name display

February 27, 2025

**Estimated date for change:** March 2025

We're enhancing how resource names are shown for AWS EC2 instances in our platform. If an EC2 instance has a "name" tag defined, the *Resource Name* field will now display the value of that tag. If no "name" tag is present, the *Resource Name* field will continue to show the *instance ID* as before. The *Resource ID* will still be available in the *Resource ID* field for reference.

Using the EC2 "name" tag lets you easily identify your resources with custom, meaningful names instead of IDs. This makes it quicker to locate and manage specific instances, reducing the time and effort spent searching or cross-referencing instance details.

### On-demand malware scanning in Microsoft Defender for Storage 

February 27, 2025

On-demand malware scanning in Microsoft Defender for Storage, now in GA, enables scanning of existing blobs in Azure Storage accounts whenever needed. Scans can be initiated from the Azure portal UI or via the REST API, supporting automation through Logic Apps, Automation playbooks, and PowerShell scripts. This feature uses Microsoft Defender Antivirus with the latest malware definitions for every scan and provides upfront cost estimation in the Azure portal before scanning.

Use cases:

- **Incident response**: Scan specific storage accounts after detecting suspicious activity.
- **Security baseline**: Scan all stored data when first enabling Defender for Storage.
- **Compliance**: Set automation to schedule scans that help meet regulatory and data protection standards.

For more information, see [On-demand malware scanning](on-demand-malware-scanning.md).

### Defender for Storage malware scanning for blobs up to 50 GB

February 27, 2025

Defender for Storage malware scanning now supports blobs up to 50GB in size (previously limited to 2GB).

Please note that for storage accounts where large blobs are uploaded, the increased blob size limit will result in higher monthly charges.

To avoid unexpected high charges, you may want to set an appropriate cap on the total GB scanned per month. For more information, see [Cost control for on-upload malware scanning](on-upload-malware-scanning.md).

### Container registry agnostic agentless vulnerability assessment for AKS runtime containers (Preview)

### Sensitivity scanning capabilities now include Azure file shares (Preview)

November 28, 2024

Defender for Cloud's Security Posture Management (CSPM) sensitivity scanning capabilities now include Azure file shares (in preview) in addition to blob containers.

Before this update, enabling the Defender CSPM plan on a subscription would automatically scan blob containers within storage accounts for sensitive data. With this update, Defender for CSPM's sensitivity scanning feature now includes file shares within those storage accounts. This enhancement improves the risk assessment and protection of sensitive storage accounts, providing a more comprehensive analysis of potential risks.

Learn more about [sensitivity scanning](concept-data-security-posture-prepare.md).

### Sensitivity label consent changes

November 26, 2024

You no longer need to select the dedicated consent button under the "Information Protection" section within the "Labels" page, to benefit from custom information types and sensitivity labels configured in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

With this change, all custom information types and sensitivity labels are automatically imported into the Microsoft Defender for Cloud portal.

Learn more about [data sensitivity settings](data-sensitivity-settings.md#import-custom-sensitivity-info-typeslabels).

### Sensitivity label changes

November 26, 2024

Until recently, Defender for Cloud imported all sensitivity labels from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal that met the following two conditions:

- Sensitivity labels that have their scope set to "Items -> Files", or "Items -> Emails", under the "Define the scope of your label" section in the Information Protection section.
- The sensitivity label has an automatic labeling rule configured.

As of November 26, 2024 the names of the sensitivity label scopes in the user interface (UI) have been updated in both the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Defender for Cloud now will only import sensitivity labels with the "Files and other data assets" scope applied to them. Defender for Cloud no longer imports labels with the "Emails" scope applied to them.

> [!NOTE]
> Labels that were configured with "Items -> Files" before this change took place are automatically migrated to the new "Files and other data assets" scope.

Learn more about [how to configure sensitivity labels](data-sensitivity-settings.md).

### Spanish National Security Framework (Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (ENS)) added to regulatory compliance dashboard for Azure

September 9, 2024

Organizations that wish to check their Azure environments for compliance with the ENS standard can now do so using Defender for Cloud.

The ENS standard applies to the entire public sector in Spain, as well as to suppliers collaborating with the Administration. It establishes basic principles, requirements, and security measures to protect information and services processed electronically. The goal is to ensure access, confidentiality, integrity, traceability, authenticity, availability, and data preservation.

### Remediate system updates and patches recommendations on your machines

September 8, 2024

You can now remediate system updates and patches recommendations on your Azure Arc-enabled machines and Azure VMs. System updates and patches are crucial for keeping the security and health of your machines. Updates often contain security patches for vulnerabilities that, if left unfixed, are exploitable by attackers.

Information about missing machine updates is now gathered using Azure Update Manager.

In order to maintain the security of your machines for system updates and patches, you'll need to enable the periodic assessment updates settings on your machines.
