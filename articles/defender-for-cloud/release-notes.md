### Enhanced container protection with vulnerability assessment and malware detection for AKS nodes is now GA
 
March 30, 2025
 
Defender for Cloud now provides vulnerability assessment and malware detection for the nodes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as GA.
Providing security protection for these Kubernetes nodes allow customers to maintain security and compliance across the managed Kubernetes service, as well as understand their part in the shared security responsibility they have with the managed cloud provider.
To receive the new capabilities, you have to enable the **Agentless scanning for machines**"** as part of Defender CSPM, Defender for Containers, or Defender for Servers P2 plan on your subscription.

#### Vulnerability Assessment

A new recommendation is now available in Azure portal: **AKS nodes should have vulnerability findings resolved.** Using this recommendation, you can now review and remediate vulnerabilities and CVEs found on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes.

#### Malware detection

New security alerts are triggered when the agentless malware detection capability detects malware in AKS nodes.
Agentless malware detection uses the Microsoft Defender Antivirus anti-malware engine to scan and detect malicious files. When threats are detected, security alerts are directed into Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR, where they can be investigated and remediated.
 
**Note:** Malware detection for AKS nodes is available only for Defender for Containers or Defender for Servers P2 enabled environments.

### Kubernetes gated deployment (Preview)

March 27, 2025

We're introducing the Kubernetes gated deployment (Preview) feature to the Defender for Containers plan. Kubernetes gated deployment is a mechanism for enhancing Kubernetes security by controlling the deployment of container images that violate organizational security policies. 

This capability is based on two new functionalities: 

- **Vulnerability findings artifact**: Generation of findings for each container image scanned for vulnerability assessment.
- **Security rules**: Addition of security rules to alert or prevent the deployment of vulnerable container images into Kubernetes clusters. 

**Customized security rules**: Customers can customize security rules for various environments, for Kubernetes clusters within their organization, or for namespaces, to enable security controls tailored to specific needs and compliance requirements.

**Configurable actions for a security rule**:

- **Audit**: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers an "Audit" action, generating a recommendation with violation details on the container image. 

- **Deny**: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers a "Deny" action to prevent deployment of the container image, ensuring that only secure and compliant images are deployed. 

**End-to-End Security**: Defining protection from deployment of vulnerable container images as the first security rule, we introduce the end-to-end Kubernetes secure gating mechanism, ensuring that vulnerable containers don't enter the customer's Kubernetes environment. 

For more information about this feature, seeâ€¯[Gated Deployment solution overview](gated-deployment-introduction.md).

### Customizable on-upload malware scanning filters in Defender for Storage (Preview)

March 27, 2025

On-upload malware scanning now supports customizable filters. Users can set exclusion rules for on-upload malware scans based on blob path prefixes, suffixes as well as by blob size.

Learn how to [enable agentless scanning for Azure VMs with CMK encrypted disks](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#enable-for-azure-vms-with-cmk-encrypted-disks).

### Upcoming change to the recommendation severity levels

March 11, 2025

We're enhancing the severity levels of recommendations to improve risk assessment and prioritization. As part of this update, we reevaluated all severity classifications and introduced a new level â€” Critical. Previously, recommendations were categorized into three levels: Low, Medium, and High. With this update, there are now four distinct levels: Low, Medium, High, and Critical, providing a more granular risk evaluation to help customers focus on the most urgent security issues.

As a result, customers might notice changes in the severity of existing recommendations. Additionally, the risk level evaluation, which is available for Defender CSPM customers only, might also be affected as both recommendation severity and asset context are taken into consideration. These adjustments could affect the overall risk level.

**The projected change will take place on March 25, 2025.**

### General Availability of File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) based on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in Azure Government 

March 03, 2025

File Integrity Monitoring based on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now GA in Azure Government (GCCH) as part of Defender for Servers Plan 2. 
- Meet compliance requirements by monitoring critical files and registries in real-time and auditing the changes.
- Identify potential security issues by detecting suspicious file content changes.

This improved FIM experience replaces the existing one that set for deprecation with the Log Analytics Agent (MMA) retirement. The [FIM experience over MMA](/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-enable-log-analytics) will remain supported in Azure Government until the end of March 2023.

With this release, an in-product experience will be released to allow you to migrate your FIM configuration over MMA to the new FIM over Defender for Endpoint version.

For information on how to enable FIM over Defender for Endpoint, see [File Integrity Monitoring using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-enable-defender-endpoint). For information on how to disable previous versions and use the migration tool, see [Migrate File Integrity Monitoring from previous versions](/azure/defender-for-cloud/migrate-file-integrity-monitoring).

### Improved AWS EC2 Resource Name display

February 27, 2025

**Estimated date for change:** March 2025

We're enhancing how resource names are shown for AWS EC2 instances in our platform. If an EC2 instance has a "name" tag defined, the *Resource Name* field will now display the value of that tag. If no "name" tag is present, the *Resource Name* field will continue to show the *instance ID* as before. The *Resource ID* will still be available in the *Resource ID* field for reference.

Using the EC2 "name" tag lets you easily identify your resources with custom, meaningful names instead of IDs. This makes it quicker to locate and manage specific instances, reducing the time and effort spent searching or cross-referencing instance details.

### On-demand malware scanning in Microsoft Defender for Storage 

February 27, 2025

On-demand malware scanning in Microsoft Defender for Storage, now in GA, enables scanning of existing blobs in Azure Storage accounts whenever needed.

### Changes to the scan interval of existing cloud connectors

December 31, 2024

Earlier this month, an [update was published](#revised-interval-options-for-defender-for-cloud-scan-of-a-cloud-environment) regarding the revised Defender for Cloud interval options for scanning a cloud environment. The scan interval setting determines how often Defender for Cloud's discovery services scan your cloud resources. This change ensures a more balanced scanning process, optimizing performance, and minimizing the risk of reaching API limits.

Scan interval settings for existing AWS and GCP cloud connectors will be updated to ensure Defender for Cloud's ability to scan your cloud environments.

The following adjustments will be made:

- Intervals currently set between 1â€“3 hours will be updated to 4 hours.
- Intervals set to 5 hours will be updated to 6 hours.
- Intervals set between 7â€“11 hours will be updated to 12 hours.
- Intervals of 13 hours or more will be updated to 24 hours.

If you prefer a different scan interval, you can adjust cloud connectors using the environment settings page. These changes will be applied automatically to all customers in early February 2025, and no further action is required.

### Sensitivity scanning capabilities now include Azure file shares

December 17, 2024

Defender for Cloud's Security Posture Management (CSPM) sensitivity scanning capabilities now include Azure file shares in GA in addition to blob containers.

Before this update, enabling the Defender CSPM plan on a subscription would automatically scan blob containers within storage accounts for sensitive data. With this update, Defender for CSPM's sensitivity scanning feature now includes file shares within those storage accounts. This enhancement improves the risk assessment and protection of sensitive storage accounts, providing a more comprehensive analysis of potential risks.

### Integrate Defender for Cloud CLI with Popular CI/CD Tools

Defender for Cloud CLI scanning integration with popular CI/CD tools in Microsoft Defender for Cloud is now available for public preview. The CLI can now be incorporated into CI/CD pipelines to scan and identify security vulnerabilities in containerized source code. This feature assists development teams in detecting and addressing code vulnerabilities during pipeline execution. It requires authentication to Microsoft Defender for Cloud and modifications to the pipeline script. Scan results will be uploaded to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, allowing security teams to view and correlate them with containers in the container registry. This solution delivers continuous and automated insights to expedite risk detection and response, ensuring security without disrupting workflows.

Use cases:

- Pipeline scanning within CI/CD tools: Securely monitor all pipelines that invoke the CLI.
- Early vulnerability detection: Results are published in the pipeline and sent to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Continuous security insights: Maintain visibility and respond swiftly across development cycles without hindering productivity.
