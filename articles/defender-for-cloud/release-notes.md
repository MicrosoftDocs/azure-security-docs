### Malware automated remediation in Defender for Storage (Preview)

September 16, 2025

Malware automated remediation in Defender for Storage malware scanning is now available in public preview. 

With this new capability, malicious blobs detected during on-upload or on-demand scanning can be automatically soft-deleted. This ensures harmful content is quarantined while still recoverable for further investigation. 

You can enable or disable malware automated remediation at either the subscription or storage account level from the Microsoft Defender for Cloud tab in the Azure portal, or by using the API. 

For more information, see [Built-in automated malware remediation for malicious blobs](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan#built-in-automated-malware-remediation-for-malicious-blobs).  

### New refined attack paths

September 9, 2025

Attack paths now reflect real, externally driven and exploitable risks that adversaries could use to compromise your organization, helping you cut through the noise and act faster. The paths now focus on external entry points and how attackers could progress through your environment reaching business-critical targets. This experience brings greater clarity, focus, and prioritization empowering security teams to mitigate the most critical risks with confidence.

Read more about it in this blog: [Refining Attack Paths: Prioritizing Real-World, Exploitable Threats](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/securityexposuremanagement/refining-attack-paths-prioritizing-real-world-exploitable-threats/4454051)

For more information, see [Identify and remediate attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md).

### Trusted Exposure

September 14, 2025 

Organizations can now define known safe IP ranges as part of the new Trusted IPs configuration via [Azure DINE policy](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Policy/Define%20MDC%20Trusted%20IPs). When configure, internet-facing resources (Azure VM/VMSS, AWS EC2, GCP Compute Instances) exposed only to these trusted IPs are treated as trusted and no attack paths are generated. This reduces false positives and enhances the quality of attack path analysis and exposure findings in recommendations. Current support includes **multi-cloud compute resources** across Azure VM/VMSS, AWS EC2, and GCP Compute Instances.

### Exposure Width 

September 14, 2025 

**Defender for Cloud now includes Exposure Width (GA)** that calculates how broadly or narrowly a resource is exposed to the public internet based on its networking rules. It helps security teams prioritize and remediate the most critical findings in attack paths and recommendations by factoring in the extent of exposure. Current support includes **multi-cloud compute resources** across Azure VM/VMSS, AWS EC2, and GCP Compute Instances.

### Trivy dependency scanning for code repositories (Update)

September 11, 2025  

Defender for Cloud now includes **open-source dependency vulnerability scanning** powered by [Trivy in filesystem ](https://trivy.dev/v0.59/docs/scanner/vulnerability/)[Trivy in filesystem mode](https://trivy.dev/v0.59/docs/scanner/vulnerability/)[mode](https://trivy.dev/v0.59/docs/scanner/vulnerability/). This helps you strengthen security by automatically detecting operating system and library vulnerabilities across GitHub and Azure DevOps repositories.  

**Where it applies:**  
- [In-pipeline (CLI) scanning](/azure/defender-for-cloud/cli-cicd-integration).  

- [Agentless code scanning (preview)](/azure/defender-for-cloud/agentless-code-scanning).

**What to do:**  
- For [Azure DevOps](quickstart-onboard-devops.md) or [GitHub](quickstart-onboard-github.md), create or edit a connector.  
- For in-pipeline scanning, add the [Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) CLI](cli-cicd-integration.md) tool to your pipeline definition.  

**Where results appear:**  
- Pipeline logs and SARIF files.  

- Defender for Cloud recommendations:  
  - *[Azure DevOps repositories should have dependency vulnerability scanning findings resolved](recommendations-reference-devops.md#azure-devops-repositories-should-have-dependency-vulnerability-scanning-findings-resolved)*  
  - *[GitHub repositories should have dependency vulnerability scanning findings resolved](recommendations-reference-devops.md#github-repositories-should-have-dependency-vulnerability-scanning-findings-resolved)*  

If you use [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) dependency scanning, Defender for Cloud now enhances, not replaces those results.  

**Effective date:** September 15, 2025.

### Enhanced container protection with vulnerability assessment and malware detection for AKS nodes is now GA

March 30, 2025

Defender for Cloud now provides vulnerability assessment and malware detection for the nodes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as GA.
Providing security protection for these Kubernetes nodes allow customers to maintain security and compliance across the managed Kubernetes service, and understand their part in the shared security responsibility they have with the managed cloud provider.
To receive the new capabilities, you have to enable the **Agentless scanning for machines**"** as part of Defender CSPM, Defender for Containers, or Defender for Servers P2 plan on your subscription.

#### Vulnerability Assessment

A new recommendation is now available in Azure portal: **AKS nodes should have vulnerability findings resolved.** Using this recommendation, you can now review and remediate vulnerabilities and CVEs found on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes.

#### Malware detection

New security alerts are triggered when the agentless malware detection capability detects malware in AKS nodes.
Agentless malware detection uses the Microsoft Defender Antivirus anti-malware engine to scan and detect malicious files. When threats are detected, security alerts are directed into Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR, where they can be investigated and remediated.

**Note:** Malware detection for AKS nodes is available only for Defender for Containers or Defender for Servers P2 enabled environments.

### Kubernetes gated deployment (Preview)

March 27, 2025

We're introducing the Kubernetes gated deployment (Preview) feature to the Defender for Containers plan. Kubernetes gated deployment is a mechanism for enhancing Kubernetes security by controlling the deployment of container images that violate organizational security policies.

This capability is based on two new functionalities:

- **Vulnerability findings artifact**: Generation of findings for each container image scanned for vulnerability assessment.
- **Security rules**: Addition of security rules to alert or prevent the deployment of vulnerable container images into Kubernetes clusters.

**Customized security rules**: Customers can customize security rules for various environments, for Kubernetes clusters within their organization, or for namespaces, to enable security controls tailored to specific needs and compliance requirements.

**Configurable actions for a security rule**:

- **Audit**: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers an "Audit" action, generating a recommendation with violation details on the container image.

- **Deny**: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers a "Deny" action to prevent deployment of the container image, ensuring that only secure and compliant images are deployed.

### Upcoming change to the recommendation severity levels

March 11, 2025

We're enhancing the severity levels of recommendations to improve risk assessment and prioritization. As part of this update, we reevaluated all severity classifications and introduced a new level — Critical. Previously, recommendations were categorized into three levels: Low, Medium, and High. With this update, there are now four distinct levels: Low, Medium, High, and Critical, providing a more granular risk evaluation to help customers focus on the most urgent security issues.

As a result, customers might notice changes in the severity of existing recommendations. Additionally, the risk level evaluation, which is available for Defender CSPM customers only, might also be affected as both recommendation severity and asset context are taken into consideration. These adjustments could affect the overall risk level.

**The projected change will take place on March 25, 2025.**
