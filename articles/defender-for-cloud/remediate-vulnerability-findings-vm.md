# Remediate machine vulnerabilities

The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides [agentless and agent-based vulnerability scanning](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md) for protected machines using Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

**Requirement** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Plan** | For agentless vulnerability scanning, Defender for Servers Plan 2 must be enabled, and agentless scanning must be on in the plan.<br/><br/>For agent-based scanning with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent, Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Defender for Servers Plan 2 must be enabled, and Defender for Endpoint integration must be enabled.
**Agentless scanning** | [Review the prerequisites](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#prerequisites) for agentless scanning.
**Agent-based scanning** | [Review the prerequisites](enable-defender-for-endpoint.md#prerequisites) for Defender for Endpoint integration in Defender for Servers.

## View scan findings

To view vulnerability assessment findings (from all of your configured scanners) and remediate identified vulnerabilities:

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open the **Recommendations** page.

1. Select the recommendation **Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved**.

    Defender for Cloud shows you all the findings for all VMs in the currently selected subscriptions. The findings are ordered by severity.

1. To filter the findings by a specific VM, open the "Affected resources" section and select the VM that interests you. Or you can select a VM from the resource health view, and view all relevant recommendations for that resource.

    Defender for Cloud shows the findings for that VM, ordered by severity.

1. To learn more about a specific vulnerability, select it.

    :::image type="content" source="media/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm/vulnerability-details.png" alt-text="Details pane for a specific vulnerability." lightbox="media/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm/vulnerability-details.png":::

    The details pane that appears contains extensive information about the vulnerability, including:

    - Links to all relevant CVEs (where available)
    - Remediation steps
    - Any more reference pages

1. To remediate a finding, follow the remediation steps from the details pane.

## Export the results

Export vulnerability assessment results with [Azure Resource Graph](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/resource-graph/). Azure Resource Graph provides instant access to resource information across your cloud environments with robust filtering, grouping, and sorting capabilities. It's a quick and efficient way to query information across Azure subscriptions programmatically or from within the Azure portal.

For full instructions and a sample ARG query, see the following Tech Community post: [Exporting vulnerability assessment results in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/exporting-vulnerability-assessment-results-in-azure-security/ba-p/1212091).

## Next steps

- [Disable specific vulnerability findings](disable-vulnerability-findings.md) as needed.
- [Review security recommendations](review-security-recommendations.md)
