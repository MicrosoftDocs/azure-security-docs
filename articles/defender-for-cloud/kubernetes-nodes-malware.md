# Kubernetes (K8s) node malware detection

Defender for Containers uses the Microsoft Defender Antivirus anti-malware engine to scan and detect malicious files in K8s nodes. When threats are detected, security alerts are directed into Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR, where they can be investigated and remediated.


## Prerequisites
Malware detection in K8s nodes must be [enabled by turning on the **Agentless scanning for machines**](./kubernetes-nodes-overview.md#prerequisite---enable-agentless-scanning-for-machines) option in the Defender for Containers or Defender for Servers P2 plan.

> [!NOTE]
> Malware detection is **not** performed on K8s nodes if agentless scanning for machines is enabled through the Defender Cloud Security Posture Management Plan. Agentless scanning for machines must be enabled through Defender for Containers or Defender for Servers P2 plan.

## Review the K8s node malware security alerts
