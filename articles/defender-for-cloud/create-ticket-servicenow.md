# Create a ticket in Defender for Cloud

The integration between Defender for Cloud with ServiceNow's IT Service Management (ITSM) module, allows Defender for Cloud customers to create tickets in Defender for Cloud that connect to a ServiceNow account. ServiceNow tickets are then linked directly to recommendations in Defender for Cloud. When a ticket is connected to a recommendation, the two platforms can facilitate efficient incident management and resolution.

## Prerequisites
