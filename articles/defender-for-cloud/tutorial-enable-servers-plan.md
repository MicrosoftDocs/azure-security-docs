# Deploy Defender for Servers

The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) that run in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and in on-premises environments. Defender for Servers provides recommendations to improve the security posture of machines, and protects machines against security threats.

This article helps you to deploy a Defender for Servers plan.

> [!NOTE]
> After a plan is enabled, a 30-day trial period begins. There is no way to stop, pause, or extend this trial period. To get the most out of the full 30-day trial, [plan your evaluation goals](plan-defender-for-servers.md).

## Prerequisites

**Requirement** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Plan your deployment** | Review the [Defender for Servers planning guide](plan-defender-for-servers.md).<br/><br/>[Check permissions needed](plan-defender-for-servers-roles.md) to deploy and work with the plan, [choose a plan and deployment scope](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md), and [understand how data is collected and stored](plan-defender-for-servers-data-workspace.md).
**Compare plan features** | [Understand and compare](defender-for-servers-overview.md) Defender for Servers plan features.
**Review pricing** | Review Defender for Servers pricing on the [Defender for Cloud pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).
**Get an Azure subscription** | You need a Microsoft Azure subscription. [Sign up for a free one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) if you need to.
**Turn on Defender for Cloud** | Make sure Defender for Cloud is [available in the subscription](connect-azure-subscription.md).
**Onboard AWS/GCP machines** | To protect AWS and GCP machines, connect [AWS accounts](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) and [GCP projects](quickstart-onboard-gcp.md) to Defender for Cloud.<br/><br/>By default the connection process onboards machines as Azure Arc-enabled VMs.
**Onboard on-premises machines** | [Onboard on-premises machines as Azure Arc VMs](quickstart-onboard-machines.md) for full functionality in Defender for Servers.<br/><br> If you onboard on-premises machines by [directly installing the Defender for Endpoint agent](onboard-machines-with-defender-for-endpoint.md) instead of onboarding Azure Arc, only Plan 1 functionality is available. In Defender for Servers Plan 2, you get only the premium Defender Vulnerability Management features in addition to Plan 1 functionality.
**Review support requirements** | Check [Defender for Servers requirements and support](support-matrix-defender-for-servers.md) information.
**Take advantage of 500 MB free data ingestion** | When Defender for Servers Plan 2 is enabled, a benefit of free 500 MB data ingestion is available for specific data types. [Learn about requirements and set up free data ingestion](data-ingestion-benefit.md)
**Defender integration** | Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Vulnerability Management are integrated by default in Defender for Cloud.<br/><br/> When you enable Defender for Servers, you give consent for the Defender for Servers plan to access Defender for Endpoint data related to vulnerabilities, installed software, and endpoint alerts.
**Enable at resource level** | Although we recommend enabling Defender for Servers for a subscription, you can [enable Defender for Servers at resource level](#enable-defender-for-servers-at-resource-level) if needed, for Azure VMs, Azure Arc-enabled servers, and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.<br/><br/> You can enable Plan 1 at the resource level.<br/><br/> You can disable Plan 1 and Plan 2 at the resource level.

## Enable on Azure, AWS, or GCP

You can enable a Defender for Servers plan for an Azure subscription, AWS account, or GCP project.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)

1. Search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. In the Defender for Cloud menu, select **Environment settings**.

1. Select the relevant Azure subscription, AWS account, or GCP project.

1. On the Defender plans page, toggle the Servers switch to **On**.

1. Select **Confirm**.

1. Select **Save**.

After enabling the plan, you have the ability to [configure the features of the plan](configure-servers-coverage.md) to suit your needs.


## Disable on a subscription

1. In Defender for Cloud, select **Environment settings**.
1. Toggle the plan switch to **Off**.


> [!Note]
> If you enabled Defender for Servers Plan 2 on a Log Analytics workspace, you need to disable it explicitly.
> To do that, navigate to the plans page for the workspace and toggle the switch to **Off**.


## Enable Defender for Servers at resource level

Although we recommend that you enable the plan for an entire Azure subscription, you might need to mix plans, exclude specific resources, or enable Defender for Servers on specific machines only. To do this, you can enable or disable Defender for Servers at the resource level.  Review [deployment scope options](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#decide-on-deployment-scope) before you start.

## Configure on individual machines

Enable and disable the plan on specific machines.

### Enable Plan 1 on a machine with the REST API

1. To enable Plan 1 for the machine, in [Update Pricings](/rest/api/defenderforcloud/pricings/update?tabs=HTTP#update-pricing-on-resource-(example-for-virtualmachines-plan)), create a PUT request with the endpoint.
1. In the PUT request, replace the subscriptionId, resourceGroupName, and machineName in the endpoint URL with your own settings.

    ```rest
        PUT
        https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{machineName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/pricings/virtualMachines?api-version=2024-01-01
    ```


1. Add this request body.

    ```json
    {
     "properties": {
    "pricingTier": "Standard",
    "subPlan": "P1"
      }
    }
    ```

### Disable the plan on a machine with the REST API

1. To disable Defender for Servers at the machine level, create a PUT request with the endpoint.
1. In the PUT request, replace the subscriptionId, resourceGroupName, and machineName in the endpoint URL with your own settings.

    ```rest
        PUT
        https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{machineName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/pricings/virtualMachines?api-version=2024-01-01
    ```
1. Add this request body.

    ```json
    {
     "properties": {
    "pricingTier": "Free",
      }
    }
    ```

### Remove the resource-level configuration with the REST API

1. To remove the machine-level configuration using the REST API, create a DELETE request with the endpoint.
1. In the DELETE request, replace the subscriptionId, resourceGroupName, and machineName in the endpoint URL with your own settings.

    ```rest
        DELETE
        https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{machineName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/pricings/virtualMachines?api-version=2024-01-01
