# Test agentless malware scanning

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides agentless malware scanning for virtual machines as part of its [agentless scanning capabilities](concept-agentless-data-collection.md) that improve machine security posture. Agentless scanning doesn't need any installed agents or network connectivity, and doesn't effect machine performance.

Malware scanning issues security alerts when threats are detected. Alerts only appear in Defender for Cloud when threats are detected on your environment. If there are no threats, alerts won't appear. 

In Defender for Cloud, you can create a test alert to make sure that malware scanning is working as expected.

## Prerequisites

- Defender for Servers Plan 2 is turned on.
- Agentless scanning is enabled in the plan.

## Create a test file for Linux

1. Open a terminal window on the VM.

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    # test string  
    TEST_STRING='$$89-barbados-dublin-damascus-notice-pulled-natural-31$$'  
     
    # File to be created  
    FILE_PATH="/tmp/virus_test_file.txt"  
     
    # Write the test string to the file  
    echo -n $TEST_STRING > $FILE_PATH  
     
    # Check if the file was created and contains the correct string  
    if [ -f "$FILE_PATH" ]; then  
        if grep -Fq "$TEST_STRING" "$FILE_PATH"; then  
            echo "Virus test file created and validated successfully."  
        else  
            echo "Virus test file does not contain the correct string."  
        fi  
    else  
        echo "Failed to create virus test file."  
    fi
    ```

The alert `MDC_Test_File malware was detected (Agentless)` will appear within 24 hours in the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and in the Defender XDR portal.

## Create a test file for Windows with a text document


1. Create a text file on your VM.

1. Paste the text `$$89-barbados-dublin-damascus-notice-pulled-natural-31$$` into the text file.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Ensure that there are no extra spaces or lines in the text file.

1. Save the file.

1. Open the file to validate that it contains the content from stage 2.

The alert `MDC_Test_File malware was detected (Agentless)` will appear within 24 hours in the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and in the Defender XDR portal.

## Create a test file for Windows with PowerShell

1. Open PowerShell on your VM.

1. Execute the following script.

```powershell
# Virus test string
$TEST_STRING = '$$89-barbados-dublin-damascus-notice-pulled-natural-31$$'

# File to be created
$FILE_PATH = "C:\temp\virus_test_file.txt"

# Create "temp" directory if it does not exist
$DIR_PATH = "C:\temp"
if (!(Test-Path -Path $DIR_PATH)) {
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $DIR_PATH
}

# Write the test string to the file without a trailing newline
[IO.File]::WriteAllText($FILE_PATH, $TEST_STRING)

# Check if the file was created and contains the correct string
if (Test-Path -Path $FILE_PATH) {
    $content = [IO.File]::ReadAllText($FILE_PATH)
    if ($content -eq $TEST_STRING) {
      Write-Host "Test file created and validated successfully."
    } else {
       Write-Host "Test file does not contain the correct string."
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "Failed to create test file."
}
```

The alert `MDC_Test_File malware was detected (Agentless)` will appear within 24 hours in the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and in the Defender XDR portal.
