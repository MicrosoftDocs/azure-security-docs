# Alerts for Resource Manager

This article lists the security alerts you might get for Resource Manager from Microsoft Defender for Cloud and any Microsoft Defender plans you enabled. The alerts shown in your environment depend on the resources and services you're protecting, and your customized configuration.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the recently added alerts powered by Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint might be undocumented.

[Learn how to respond to these alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.md).

[Learn how to export alerts](continuous-export.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts from different sources might take different amounts of time to appear. For example, alerts that require analysis of network traffic might take longer to appear than alerts related to suspicious processes running on virtual machines.

## Resource Manager alerts

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts with a **delegated access** indication are triggered due to activity of third-party service providers. learn more about [service providers activity indications](defender-for-resource-manager-usage.md).
