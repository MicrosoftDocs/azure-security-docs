# Explore and investigate Defender for SQL security alerts

There are several ways to view Microsoft Defender for SQL alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud:

- The **Alerts** page.

- The machine's security page.

- The [workload protections dashboard](workload-protections-dashboard.md).

- Through the direct link provided in the alert's email.

## How to view alerts

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. Select **Security alerts**.

1. Select an alert.

Alerts are designed to be self-contained, with detailed remediation steps and investigation information in each one. You can investigate further by using other Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel capabilities for a broader view:

- Enable SQL Server's auditing feature for further investigations. If you're a Microsoft Sentinel user, you can upload the SQL auditing logs from the Windows Security Log events to Sentinel and enjoy a rich investigation experience.

- To improve your security posture, use Defender for Cloud's recommendations for the host machine indicated in each alert to reduce the risks of future attacks.
