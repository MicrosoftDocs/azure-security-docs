# Antimalware detection and prevention

Container runtime antimalware detection and prevention happens when a container runs an executable that the system identifies as malware.

This feature provides alerts when it identifies malware and allows you to block it. You can define antimalware policies to specify conditions for generating alerts and blocking, helping you distinguish between legitimate activities and potential threats. 

Container runtime antimalware detection and prevention is integrated into the Defender for Containers plan and is available for the Azure (AKS), Amazon (EKS), and Google (GKE) clouds. 

## Prerequisites

- To use container runtime antimalware detection and prevention, you need to run the Defender for Container sensor, which is available for the AWS, GCP, and AKS clouds. Currently, this feature is in preview and is only supported for:
    - **AKS**: Helm provisioning with sensor version **0.10.1**.
    - **Multicloud**: Helm provisioning with sensor version **0.10.1** or the ARC extension using `release train=preview`.

- You must enable the Defender for Container sensor on the subscriptions and connectors. 

- To create and modify antimalware policies, you need Security Admin or higher permissions on the tenant. To view antimalware policies, you need Security Reader or higher permissions on the tenant. 

- In addition to the [core sensor memory and CPU requirements](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-architecture?tabs=defender-for-container-arch-aks#defender-sensor-component-details), you need:    
  
    | Component | Request | Limit |
    |--|--|--|
    | CPU | 50m | 300m |
    | Memory | 128Mi | 500Mi |

### Components

The following components are part of antimalware detection and prevention: 

- An enhanced sensor that detects and prevents malware.

- Antimalware policy configuration options.

- Antimalware alerts.

## Enable antimalware detection and prevention

Antimalware isn't enabled by default because it consumes extra cluster resources.

To install the sensor with antimalware enabled, follow the instructions to [install Defender for Containers sensor by using Helm](deploy-helm.md) and include the `--antimalware` flag.

## Add antimalware rules

When you install the sensor with antimalware enabled, it configures three antimalware rules by default. These rules include: 

- `Malware alert on binaries not originated from original image`: a suggested rule for situations where the system detects a drifted binary.
- `Default antimalware workload rule`.
- `Default anitmalware host rule`.

The two default antimalware rules (workload and host) apply to every potential situation if no other rule matches first. You can only modify the default rule's actions and set it to alert, block, or ignore.  

You can create new antimalware rules to define when alerts should be generated, blocked, or ignored. Each rule can define the conditions for generating alerts. This structure allows you to tailor the system to your specific needs and reduce false positives. You can create exclusions by setting higher priority rules for specific scopes or clusters, images, pods, Kubernetes labels, or namespaces. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to **Defender for Cloud** > **Environment ettings**.

1. Select **Security rules**.

1.  Select **Antiwalware** > **+ Add rule**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/anti-malware/configure-new-rule-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add Rule side panel showing fields for rule name, conditions, and actions with options to alert, block, or ignore." lightbox="media/anti-malware/configure-new-rule-screen.png":::

1.  Enter a rule name.
 
1. Select an available action:
    - **Ignore Malware**: Ignore the selected malware.
    - **Alert on Malware**:  Generate an alert. For example, if a rule detects a drifted binary.
    - **Block Malware**: Block the malware from running.

1. Enter a scope name.

1. Select a cloud scope and (optional) specific subscription.

1. (Optional) Select a resource scope.

1. (Optional) Add conditions to the resource scope based on the following categories: **Container name**, **Image name**, **Namespace**, **Pod labels**, **Pod name**, or **Cluster name**. Then choose an operator: **Starts with**, **Ends with**, **Equals**, or **Contains**. Finally, enter the value to match. You can add as many conditions as needed by selecting **+Add condition**.

1. (Optional) Select the checkbox to exclude binaries from container image.

1. (Optional) Add **Allow list for processes**, a list of processes that are allowed to run in the container. If a process isn't on this list, an alert is generated. 

1.  Select **Apply**.

1. Select **Save**.

After 30 minutes, the sensors on the protected clusters are updated with the new rule.

## Manage antimalware rules

Based on the alerts you receive and your review of them, you might need to adjust your rules in the antimalware policy. This adjustment could involve refining conditions, adding new rules, or removing rules that generate too many false positives. The goal is to ensure that the defined antimalware policies and their rules effectively balance security needs with operational efficiency. 

The effectiveness of antimalware detection relies on your active engagement in configuring, monitoring, and adjusting policies to suit your environment's unique requirements. 

You can arrange the rules based on priority by selecting the up or down arrow. The rule with the highest priority (lowest number) is evaluated first. If a rule match occurs, the action designated by the rule happens and the evaluation ends. If no match is found, the next rule is evaluated. If no match occurs with any of the existing rules, the default rules are applied.

You can manage each rule by using the toolbar.

:::image type="content" source="media/anti-malware/rule-toolbar.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the toolbar that can be used to manage the rules." lightbox="media/anti-malware/rule-toolbar.png":::

The toolbar allows you to edit, duplicate, delete, enable, and disable rules. Simply select a rule and the desired action.

Disabling a rule allows you to keep the rule and its configuration without applying it. This option is useful if you want to temporarily stop a rule from being applied without losing its configuration.

After you configure your rules, select **Save** to apply the changes and create the policy. Within 30 minutes, the sensors on the protected clusters are updated with the new policy.
