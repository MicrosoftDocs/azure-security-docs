# Containers support matrix in Defender for Cloud

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) as of June 30, 2024. Please consider your use and planning accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life).

This article summarizes support information for Container capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Specific features are in preview. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include other legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
> - Only the versions of AKS, EKS and GKE supported by the cloud vendor are officially supported by Defender for Cloud.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Defender for Cloud Containers Vulnerability Assessment powered by Qualys is being retired. The retirement will be completed by March 6, and until that time partial results might still appear both in the Qualys recommendations, and Qualys results in the security graph. Any customers who were previously using this assessment should upgrade to to [Vulnerability assessments for Azure with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](agentless-vulnerability-assessment-azure.md). For information about transitioning to the container vulnerability assessment offering powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, see [Transition from Qualys to Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](transition-to-defender-vulnerability-management.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For additional requirements for Kubernetes workload protection, see [existing limitations](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes#limitations).

### Supported host operating systems

Defender for Containers relies on the **Defender sensor** for several features. The Defender sensor is supported on the following host operating systems:

- Amazon Linux 2
- CentOS 8  (CentOS is End Of Life (EOL) as of June 30, 2024. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life).)
- Debian 10
- Debian 11
- Google Container-Optimized OS
- Mariner 1.0
- Mariner 2.0
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04

Ensure your Kubernetes node is running on one of the verified supported operating systems. Clusters with different host operating systems, only get partial coverage.

### Defender sensor limitations

The Defender sensor in AKS V1.28 and below isn't supported on Arm64 nodes.

### Network restrictions

#### Outbound proxy support

Outbound proxy without authentication and outbound proxy with basic authentication are supported. Outbound proxy that expects trusted certificates is currently not supported.
