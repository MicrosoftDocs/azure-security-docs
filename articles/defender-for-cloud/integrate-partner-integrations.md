# Integrate partner integrations

Microsoft Defender for Cloud integrates with both Microsoft services and partner solutions. By integrating partner integrations into your environment, you can enhance your security posture and add extra layers of protection to your resources and multicloud environments.

Each integration offers different benefits and capabilities. For example, some integrations help you to simplify deployment, while others help you to integrate detection, unify monitoring and management, and extend capabilities.

You can review the [list of available integrations](partner-integrations.md).
