## Serverless protection overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud, as a Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP), delivers comprehensive visibility, security, and posture management for serverless workloads across multi-cloud environments. It extends coverage to Azure Web Apps, Azure Functions, and AWS Lambda, ensuring these resources are fully protected. 

Serverless protection provides automatic discovery, which allows Defender for Cloud to identify all Web Apps, Azure Functions, and AWS Lambda functions that are deployed in your environment and lists them under a unified inventory. Once these resources are discovered, Defender for Cloud can then identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and insecure dependencies. Defender for Cloud then offers remediation guidance and continuous posture assessment, helping organizations maintain strong posture management and reduce risk in dynamic, serverless architectures.

## Serverless protection requirements

Serverless protection is available as part of the Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) plan. To enable serverless protection, you must first enable the Defender CSPM plan on your subscription.
