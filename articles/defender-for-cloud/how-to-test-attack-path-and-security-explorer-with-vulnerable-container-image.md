# Attack path analysis and enhanced risk-hunting for containers

Attack path analysis is a graph-based algorithm that scans the cloud security graph. The scans expose exploitable paths that attackers might use to breach your environment to reach your high-impact assets. Attack path analysis exposes attack paths and suggests recommendations as to how best remediate issues that break the attack path and prevent successful breach.

Explore and investigate [attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md) by sorting them based on risk level, name, environment, and risk factors, entry point, target, affected resources and active recommendations. Explore cloud security graph Insights on the resource. Examples of Insight types are:

- Pod exposed to the internet
- Privileged container
- Pod uses host network
- Container image is vulnerable to remote code execution

## Azure: Testing the attack path and security explorer using a mock vulnerable container image

If there are no entries in the list of attack paths, you can still test this feature by using a mock container image. Use the following steps to set up the test:

**Requirement:** An instance of Azure Container Registry (ACR) in the tested scope.

1. Import a mock vulnerable image to your Azure Container Registry:

    1. First, pull a base image (for example, alpine) to your local environment by running:

        ```azurecli
        docker pull alpine
        ```
    
    1. Tag the image with the following label and push it to your ACR. Replace `<MYACR>` with your Azure Container Registry name:
    
        ```azurecli
        docker tag alpine <MYACR>.azurecr.io/mdc-mock-0001
        docker push <MYACR>.azurecr.io/mdc-mock-0001
        ```

    1. If you don't have an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster, use the following command to create a new AKS cluster:

        ```azurecli
        az aks create -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --generate-ssh-keys --attach-acr $MYACR
        ```

    1. If your AKS isn't attached to your ACR, use the following Cloud Shell command line to point your AKS instance to pull images from the selected ACR:

        ```azurecli
        az aks update -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --attach-acr <acr-name>
        ```

1. Authenticate your Cloud Shell session to work with the cluster:

    ```azurecli
    az aks get-credentials  --subscription <cluster-suid> --resource-group <your-rg> --name <your-cluster-name>    
    ```

1. Install the [ngnix ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/) :

    ```azurecli
    helm install ingress-controller oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-ingress --version 1.0.1
    ```

1. Deploy the mock vulnerable image to expose the vulnerable container to the internet by running the following command:

    ```azurecli
    helm install dcspmcharts  oci://mcr.microsoft.com/mdc/stable/dcspmcharts --version 1.0.0 --namespace mdc-dcspm-demo --create-namespace --set image=<your-image-uri> --set distribution=AZURE
    ```

1. Verify success by doing the following steps:

   - Look for an entry with **mdc-dcspm-demo** as namespace
   - In the **Workloads-> Deployments** tab, verify “pod” created 3/3 and **dcspmcharts-ingress-nginx-controller** 1/1.
   - In services and ingresses look for-> services **service**, **dcspmcharts-ingress-nginx-controller and dcspmcharts-ingress-nginx-controller-admission**. In the ingress tab, verify one **ingress** is created with an IP address and nginx class.

> [!NOTE]
> After completing the above flow, it can take up to 24 hours to see results in the cloud security explorer and attack path.

After you completed testing the attack path, investigate the created attack path by going to **Attack path analysis**, and search for the attack path you created. For more information, see [Identify and remediate attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md).

## AWS: Testing the attack path and security explorer using a mock vulnerable container image

1. Create an ECR repository named *mdc-mock-0001*
1. Go to your AWS account and choose **Command line or programmatic access**.
1. Open a command line and choose **Option 1: Set AWS environment variables (Short-term credentials)**. Copy the credentials of the *AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID*, *AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY*, and *AWS_SESSION_TOKEN* environment variables.
1. Run the following command to get the authentication token for your Amazon ECR registry. Replace `<REGION>` with the region of your registry. Replace `<ACCOUNT>` with your AWS account ID.

    ```awscli
    aws ecr get-login-password --region <REGION> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ACCOUNT>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com
    ```

1. Create a Docker image that is tagged as vulnerable by name. The name of the image should contain the string *mdc-mock-0001*. Once you created the image, push it to your ECR registry, with the following command (replace `<ACCOUNT>` and `<REGION>` with your AWS account ID and region):

    ```awscli
    docker pull alpine
    docker tag alpine <ACCOUNT>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/mdc-mock-0001
    docker push <ACCOUNT>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/mdc-mock-0001
    ```

1. Connect to your EKS cluster and install the provided Helm chart. Configure `kubectl` to work with your EKS cluster. Run this command (replace `<your-region>` and `<your-cluster-name>` with your EKS cluster region and name):

    ```awscli
    aws eks --region <your-region> update-kubeconfig --name <your-cluster-name>
    ```

1. Verify the configuration. You can check if `kubectl` is correctly configured by running:

    ```awscli
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

1. Install the [ngnix ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/) :

    ```azurecli
    helm install ingress-controller oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-ingress --version 1.0.1
    ```

1. Install the following Helm chart:

    ```awscli
    helm install dcspmcharts oci://mcr.microsoft.com/mdc/stable/dcspmcharts --version 1.0.0 --namespace mdc-dcspm-demo --create-namespace --set image=<ACCOUNT>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/mdc-mock-0001 --set distribution=AWS
    ```

The Helm chart deploys resources onto your cluster that can be used to infer attack paths. It also includes the vulnerable image.

> [!NOTE]
> After completing the above flow, it can take up to 24 hours to see results in the cloud security explorer and attack path.

After you completed testing the attack path, investigate the created attack path by going to **Attack path analysis**, and search for the attack path you created. For more information, see [Identify and remediate attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md).

## GCP: Testing the attack path and security explorer using a mock vulnerable container image

1. In the GCP portal, search for **Artifact Registry**, and then create a GCP repository named *mdc-mock-0001*
1. Follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling) to push the image to your repository. Run these commands:

    ```docker
    docker pull alpine
    docker tag alpine <LOCATION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REGISTRY>/<REPOSITORY>/mdc-mock-0001
    docker push <LOCATION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REGISTRY>/<REPOSITORY>/mdc-mock-0001
    ```

1. Go to the GCP portal. Then go to **Kubernetes Engine** > **Clusters**. Select the **Connect** button.
1. Once connected,  either run the command in the Cloud Shell or copy the connection command and run it on your machine:

   ```gcloud-cli
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials contra-bugbash-gcp --zone us-central1-c --project onboardingc-demo-gcp-1
   ```

1. Verify the configuration. You can check if `kubectl` is correctly configured by running:

    ```gcloud-cli
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

1. To install the Helm chart, follow these steps:

    1. Under **Artifact registry** in the portal, go to the repository, and find the image URI under **Pull by digest**.
    1. Use the following command to install the Helm chart:

        ```gcloud-cli
        helm install dcspmcharts oci:/mcr.microsoft.com/mdc/stable/dcspmcharts --version 1.0.0 --namespace mdc-dcspm-demo --create-namespace --set image=<IMAGE_URI> --set distribution=GCP
        ```

The Helm chart deploys resources onto your cluster that can be used to infer attack paths. It also includes the vulnerable image.

> [!NOTE]
> After completing the above flow, it can take up to 24 hours to see results in the cloud security explorer and attack path.

After you completed testing the attack path, investigate the created attack path by going to **Attack path analysis**, and search for the attack path you created. For more information, see [Identify and remediate attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md).

## Find container posture issues with cloud security explorer

You can build queries in one of the following ways:

- [Explore risks with built-in cloud security explorer templates](#explore-risks-with-cloud-security-explorer-templates)
- [Create custom queries with cloud security explorer](#create-custom-queries-with-cloud-security-explorer)

In the following sections, we present examples of queries you can select or create.

### Explore risks with cloud security explorer templates

1. From the Defender for Cloud overview page, open the cloud security explorer.

1. Some out of the box templates for Kubernetes appear. Select one of the templates:

    - **Azure Kubernetes pods running images with high severity vulnerabilities**
    - **Kubernetes namespaces contain vulnerable pods**
  
    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-test-attack-path/select-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select templates." lightbox="media/how-to-test-attack-path/select-template.png":::

1. Select **Open query**; the template builds the query in the upper portion of the screen. Select **Search** to view the results.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-test-attack-path/query-builder-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the query built and where to select search." lightbox="media/how-to-test-attack-path/query-builder-search.png":::

### Create custom queries with cloud security explorer

You can also create your own custom queries. The following example shows a search for pods running container images that are vulnerable to remote code execution.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-test-attack-path/custom-query-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a custom query." lightbox="media/how-to-test-attack-path/custom-query-search.png":::

The results are listed below the query.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-test-attack-path/custom-query-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the results from a custom query." lightbox="media/how-to-test-attack-path/custom-query-results.png":::
