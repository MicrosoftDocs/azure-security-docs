# Agentless scanning for Serverless

Microsoft Defender for Cloud, as a Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP), delivers comprehensive visibility, security, and posture management for serverless workloads across multi-cloud environments. It extends coverage to Azure Web Apps, Azure Functions, and AWS Lambda, ensuring these critical resources are fully protected. One of its key strengths is automatic discovery: Defender for Cloud identifies all deployed Web Apps, Azure Functions, and AWS Lambda functions in your environment and lists them under a unified inventory. From there, it provides continuous posture assessment, helping organizations maintain strong security hygiene and reduce risk in dynamic, serverless architectures.
