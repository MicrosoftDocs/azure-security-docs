# Map container images from code to cloud

When a vulnerability is identified in a container image, whether itâ€™s stored in a container registry or running in a Kubernetes cluster, security practitioners might struggle to trace it back to the CI/CD pipeline that originally built it. Without that context, it's difficult to identify the developer responsible for fixing the issue. Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) includes DevOps security capabilities that let you map your cloud-native applications from code to cloud. As a result, you can easily kick off developer remediation workflows and reduce the time it takes to remediate vulnerabilities in your container images.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with Defender for Cloud onboarded. If you don't already have an Azure account, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- For Azure DevOps:

  - [Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) Extension](azure-devops-extension.yml) must be installed on the Azure DevOps organization. 
    
  - Ensure that the Microsoft Defender for DevOps Extension is shared and installed in all connected Azure DevOps organizations. For newly onboarded connectors, this is done automatically. This extension automatically injects tasks into all Azure Pipelines to collect data for container mapping. 
    
  - Must use [YAML Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-get-started) as Classic Pipelines are no longer supported. 
    
- For GitHub:

  - [Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) Action](github-action.md) must be configured in your GitHub workflows. 
    
  - The GitHub Workflow must have "**id-token: write"** permissions for federation with Defender for Cloud. For an example, see [this YAML](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action/blob/7e3060ae1e6a9347dd7de6b28195099f39852fe2/.github/workflows/on-push-verification.yml).
- [Defender CSPM](tutorial-enable-cspm-plan.md) enabled.
- The container images must be built using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the Docker client must be able to access the Docker server during the build.

## Map your container image from Azure DevOps pipelines to the container registry

After building a container image in an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline and pushing it to a registry, see the mapping by using the [Cloud Security Explorer](how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer.md):

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Cloud Security Explorer**. It can take a maximum of 4 hours for the container image mapping to appear in the Cloud Security Explorer.

1. To see basic mapping, select **Container Images** > **+** > **Pushed by code repositories**.

1. (Optional) Select + by **Container Images** to add other filters to your query, such as **Has vulnerabilities** to filter only container images with CVEs.

1. After running your query, you'll see the mapping between container registry and Azure DevOps pipeline. Select **...** next to the edge to see more details on where the Azure DevOps pipeline was run.

The following is an example of an advanced query that utilizes container image mapping. Starting with a Kubernetes workload that is exposed to the internet, you can trace all container images with high severity CVEs back to the Azure DevOps pipeline where the container image was built, empowering a security practitioner to kick off a developer remediation workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> If your Azure DevOps organization had the Azure DevOps connector created prior to November 15, 2023, navigate to **Organization settings** > **Extensions > Shared** and install the container image mapping decorator. If you don't see the extension shared with your organization, fill out the following [form](https://aka.ms/ContainerImageMappingForm).

## Map your container image from GitHub workflows to the container registry

1. Ensure you onboarded a [GitHub connector](quickstart-onboard-github.md) to Defender for Cloud.

1. Run the following MSDO workflow:

```yml
name: Build and Map Container Image

on: [push, workflow_dispatch]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Set Permissions
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.8' 
    # Set Authentication to Container Registry of Choice. 
    # The example below is for Azure Container Registry. Amazon Elastic Container Registry and Google Artifact Registry are also supported. 
   - name: Azure Container Registry Login 
        uses: Azure/docker-login@v1 
        with:
        login-server: <containerRegistryLoginServer>
        username: ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}
    # Build and Push Image
    - name: Build and Push the Docker image 
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.IMAGE_TAG }}
          file: Dockerfile
     # Run Mapping Tool in MSDO
    - name: Run Microsoft Security DevOps Analysis
      uses: microsoft/security-devops-action@latest
      id: msdo
```
