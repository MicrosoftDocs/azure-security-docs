# What is Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a comprehensive [Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)](#cloud-native-application-protection-platform-cnapp) that provides a comprehensive view of your security posture across your cloud and on-premises resources. Defender for Cloud assists organizations to secure their multi-cloud and hybrid environments while seamlessly integrating security into DevOps workflows. Defender for Cloud unifies three foundational pillars: 

- [Development Security Operations (DevSecOps)](#development-security-operations-devsecops) which unifies security management at the code level across multicloud and multi-pipeline environments.

- [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](#cloud-security-posture-management-cspm) which continuously evaluates and strengthens the security posture of cloud resources.

- [Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)](#cloud-workload-protection-platform-cwpp) which defends workloads like virtual machines (VM), containers, storage, databases and serverless functions from threats.

Defender for Cloud utilizes its broader CNAPP capabilities to bring protections together into a cohesive experience. By embedding security earlier in the development lifecycle, Defender for Cloud empowers DevOps teams to identify misconfigurations, enforce policies, and remediate risks proactivelyâ€”enabling secure innovation at cloud speed.

## Development Security Operations (DevSecOps)

Defender for Cloud helps you incorporate good security practices early in the software development process, or DevSecOps. You can protect your code management environments and code pipelines, and get insights into your development environment security posture from a single location. It enables security teams to manage DevOps security across multi-pipeline environments.

Today's applications require security awareness at the code, infrastructure, and runtime levels to ensure that deployed applications are hardened against attacks.

## Cloud workload protection platform (CWPP)

Proactive security principles require implementing security practices to protect your workloads from threats. Cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) provide workload-specific recommendations to guide you to the right security controls to protect your workloads.

When your environment is threatened, security alerts immediately indicate the nature and severity of the threat so you can plan your response. After identifying a threat in your environment, respond quickly to limit the risk to your resources.
