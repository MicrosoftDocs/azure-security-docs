# Disable vulnerability findings (Secure score)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud lets you customize your secure score by controlling which vulnerability assessment findings are included in the score. You can do this by creating disable rules, which suppress specific findings for container registry images and running images.

Disable rules help you exclude findings that aren't relevant to your organization so they don’t affect your secure score or appear in your vulnerability findings list.

## How disable rules work

Disable rules control how Defender for Cloud evaluates vulnerability assessment findings for container registry images and running container images. A disable rule tells Defender for Cloud to ignore specific findings that match the criteria you define.

When a finding is disabled:

- it doesn't appear in the list of vulnerability findings,
- it doesn't affect your secure score, and
- it doesn't generate alerts or recommendations.

Disable rules are applied per recommendation. To disable the same CVE or criteria for both registry images and running images, create a rule in each recommendation.

Disable rules are commonly used to:

- exclude low-severity findings,
- ignore vulnerabilities in images the vendor won’t fix, or
- suppress findings that aren't relevant to your environment.

## Prerequisites

- To create a rule, you need permissions to edit a policy in Azure Policy. Learn more in [Azure RBAC permissions in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview#azure-rbac-permissions-in-azure-policy).

> [!NOTE]
> You can customize your vulnerability assessment experience by exempting management groups, subscriptions, or specific resources from your secure score. Learn how to [create an exemption](exempt-resource.md) for a resource or subscription.

## Create a disable rule:

1. From the recommendations detail page for [Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5) or [Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c609cf0f-71ab-41e9-a3c6-9a1f7fe1b8d5), select **Disable rule**.

1. Select the scope where you want the rule to apply.

1. Define your criteria. Disable rules can match findings based on:

3. Define your criteria. Disable rules can match findings based on:

   - **CVE** – Enter one or more valid CVE identifiers, separated by semicolons.  
     For example, `CVE-2020-1347;CVE-2020-1346`

   - **Image digest** – Specify the digests of images whose vulnerability findings you want to exclude. Separate multiple digests with semicolons.  
     For example:  
     `sha256:9b920e938111710c2768b31699aac9d1ae80ab6284454e8a9ff42e887fa1db31;sha256:ab0ab32f75988da9b146de7a3589c47e919393ae51bbf2d8a0d55dd92542451c`

   - **OS version** – Specify OS versions to exclude *for images running that OS*. Separate multiple OS versions with semicolons.  
     For example: `ubuntu_linux_20.04;alpine_3.17`

   - **Minimum severity** – Exclude vulnerabilities that are *less than or equal to* the selected severity (low, medium, high, or critical).

   - **Fix status** – Exclude vulnerabilities based on whether a fix is available. 
     For example: "Fix available", "No fix", "Unknown"

1. Enter a justification explaining why the finding is being disabled. This helps maintain clarity and auditability.

1. Select **Apply rule**.

Disable rule changes can take up to 24 hours to take effect. When the rule is active, it appears on the Disable rule page with a **Rule applied** status.

## View a disable rule

1. From the recommendation details page, select **Disable rule**.

1. Select the ellipsis (**…**) next to the rule and choose **View rule**.

## Override a disable rule

1. From the recommendation details page, select **Disable rule**.

1. Select the ellipsis (**…**) next to the rule you want to override.

1. Select **View rule**.

1. Update the criteria as needed and select **Override rule** to apply the changes.
   
## Delete a disable rule

1. From the recommendation details page, select **Disable rule**.

1. Select the ellipsis (**…**) next to the rule you want to delete.

1. Select **Delete rule**.
