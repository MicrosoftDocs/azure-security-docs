# Create exemptions and disable vulnerabilities (Secure score)

Defender for Cloud lets you create exemptions and disable vulnerability assessment findings on container registry images and running images (secure score). This feature lets you customize your secure score results and manage the findings relevant to your organization.

If your organization needs to ignore a finding instead of remediating it, you can disable it. Disabled findings don't affect your secure score or generate unwanted alerts or recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- To create a rule, you need permissions to edit a policy in Azure Policy. Learn more in [Azure RBAC permissions in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview#azure-rbac-permissions-in-azure-policy).

> [!NOTE]
> You can customize your vulnerability assessment experience by exempting management groups, subscriptions, or specific resources from your secure score. Learn how to [create an exemption](exempt-resource.md) for a resource or subscription.

## Create a disable rule

Create a disable rule for vulnerability findings on registry images and running images (secure score) from the recommendations detail page in Defender for Cloud.

When a finding matches the criteria you defined in your disable rules, it won't appear in the list of findings.

Typical scenarios include:

- Disabling findings with severity below medium
- Disabling findings for images that the vendor won't fix

Disable rules use a combination of the following criteria:

- **CVE** - Enter the CVEs of the findings you want to exclude. Ensure the CVEs are valid. Separate multiple CVEs with a semicolon. For example, CVE-2020-1347; CVE-2020-1346.
- **Image digest** - Specify images for which vulnerabilities should be excluded based on the image digest. Separate multiple digests with a semicolon, for example: `sha256:9b920e938111710c2768b31699aac9d1ae80ab6284454e8a9ff42e887fa1db31;sha256:ab0ab32f75988da9b146de7a3589c47e919393ae51bbf2d8a0d55dd92542451c`
- **OS version** - Specify images for which vulnerabilities should be excluded based on the image OS. Separate multiple versions with a semicolon, for example: ubuntu_linux_20.04;alpine_3.17
- **Minimum Severity** - Select low, medium, high, or critical to exclude vulnerabilities less than the specified severity level.
- **Fix status** - Select the option to exclude vulnerabilities based on their fix status.

Disable rules apply per recommendation, for example, to disable [CVE-2017-17512](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fc69-2v7r-7r95) both on the registry images and runtime images, the disable rule has to be configured in both places.

### Create the disable rule:

1. From the recommendations detail page for [Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5) or [Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c609cf0f-71ab-41e9-a3c6-9a1f7fe1b8d5), select **Disable rule**.

1. Select the relevant scope.

1. Define your criteria. You can use any of the following criteria:

    - **CVE** - Enter the CVEs of the findings you want to exclude. Ensure the CVEs are valid. Separate multiple CVEs with a semicolon. For example, CVE-2020-1347; CVE-2020-1346.
    - **Image digest** - Specify images for which vulnerabilities should be excluded based on the image digest. Separate multiple digests with a semicolon, for example: `sha256:9b920e938111710c2768b31699aac9d1ae80ab6284454e8a9ff42e887fa1db31;sha256:ab0ab32f75988da9b146de7a3589c47e919393ae51bbf2d8a0d55dd92542451c`
    - **OS version** - Specify images for which vulnerabilities should be excluded based on the image OS. Separate multiple versions with a semicolon, for example: ubuntu_linux_20.04;alpine_3.17
    - **Minimum Severity** - Select low, medium, high, or critical to exclude vulnerabilities less than and equal to the specified severity level.
    - **Fix status** - Select the option to exclude vulnerabilities based on their fix status.

1. In the justification text box, add your justification for why a specific vulnerability was disabled. This provides clarity and understanding for anyone reviewing the rule.

1. Select **Apply rule**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Changes might take up to 24 hours to take effect.

## View, override, or delete a rule

1. From the recommendations detail page, select **Disable rule**.
1. From the scope list, subscriptions with active rules show as **Rule applied**.
1. To view or delete the rule, select the ellipsis menu ("...").
1. Do one of the following:
    - To view or override a disable rule - select **View rule**, make any changes you want, and select **Override rule**.
    - To delete a disable rule - select **Delete rule**.
