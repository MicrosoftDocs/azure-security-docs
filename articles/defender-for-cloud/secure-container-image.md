# Securing a container image with a unique signature

Container images are essential for deploying applications consistently across different environments. However, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of these images is crucial to prevent tampering and security breaches. This is where signing and verifying container images come into play.

Signing and verifying container images are critical steps to ensure the security and integrity of your containerized applications. By using Notary Project to sign and verify the Open VeX format vulnerability reports, you enable the use of policies to control deployment your container images.
