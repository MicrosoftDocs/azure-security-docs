# Securing a container image with a unique signature

Container images are essential for deploying applications consistently across different environments. However, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of these images is crucial to prevent tampering and security breaches. This is where signing and verifying container images come into play.

Signing and verifying container images are critical steps to ensure the security and integrity of your containerized applications. The vulnerability findings artifact is signed with a Microsoft certificate for integrity and authenticity and is associated with the container image in the registry for validation needs.
