# AI security recommendations

This article lists all the AI security recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

The recommendations that appear in your environment are based on the resources that you're protecting and on your customized configuration. You can [see the recommendations in the portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/~/5) that apply to your resources.

To learn about actions that you can take in response to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Defender for Cloud](implement-security-recommendations.md).


## Azure recommendations

### Microsoft Entra ID should be used when connecting Azure AI Foundry to default storage account

**Description:** Defender for Cloud identified Credential-based access when connecting to the default storage account in Azure AI Foundry. This poses a risk of unauthorized access. To reduce the risk of unauthorized access, you should disable key-based authorization, and instead use Microsoft Entra ID.

**Severity**: High

### Microsoft Entra ID should be used when connecting to data stores on Azure AI Foundry project

**Description:** Defender for Cloud identified Credential-based access when connecting to the storage account in Azure AI Foundry project. This poses a risk of unauthorized access. To reduce the risk of unauthorized access, you should disable key-based authorization, and instead use Microsoft Entra ID.

**Severity**: High

### Application Insights should be used on Azure AI Foundry

**Description:** Defender for Cloud identified that Application insights is not configured in Azure AI Foundry. The AI Foundry uses Azure Application Insights to store monitoring information about your deployed models. This poses a risk of delayed threat detection and ineffective incident response.

**Severity**: Medium

### Network connections should be limited on Azure AI Foundry

**Description:** Defender for Cloud identified public network access enabled for all networks in Azure AI Foundry. This poses a risk of exposure to external threats and can result in unauthorized access and data breaches. By restricting network access, you can ensure that only allowed networks can access the service.

**Severity**: Medium

### (Enable if required) Customer-managed keys should be used to encrypt data on Azure AI Foundry

**Description:** Defender for Cloud identified that Microsoft-managed keys are used to encrypt data in Azure AI Foundry. This poses a risk of not complying with regulations for organizations with related compliance requirements. Using customer-managed keys (CMK) to encrypt data at rest provides more control over the key lifecycle, including rotation and management, and is often required to meet compliance standards. This is not assessed by default and should only be applied when required by compliance or restrictive policy requirements. If not enabled, the data will be encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys. To implement this recommendation, update the 'Effect' parameter in the Security Policy for the applicable scope.

**Severity**: Medium

### Azure AI Services resources should have key access disabled (disable local authentication)

**Description**: Key access (local authentication) is recommended to be disabled for security. Azure OpenAI Studio, typically used in development/testing, requires key access, and will not function if key access is disabled. After the setting is disabled, Microsoft Entra ID becomes the only access method, which allows maintaining minimum privilege principle and granular control.
