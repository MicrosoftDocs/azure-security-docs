# Find and fix vulnerabilities in your Azure SQL databases

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides [SQL vulnerability assessment](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md) for your Azure SQL databases. SQL vulnerability assessment scans your databases for software vulnerabilities and provides a list of findings. Use the findings to fix software vulnerabilities and disable findings.

SQL vulnerability assessment is available in two configurations: **express** and **classic**. Some operational behavior (such as baseline timing) depends on the configuration model. For differences between these models, see [SQL vulnerability assessment overview](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md) 

::: zone pivot="defender-portal"

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you know whether you're using the [express or classic configurations](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md#what-are-the-express-and-classic-configurations) before you continue.

To see which configuration you're using:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the specific resource in Azure SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance Database, or Azure Synapse.

1. Under the **Security** heading, select **Defender for Cloud**.

1. In the **Enablement Status**, select **Configure** to open the Microsoft Defender for SQL settings pane for either the entire server or managed instance.

If the vulnerability settings show the option to configure a storage account, you're using the classic configuration. If not, you're using the express configuration.

## Run scans and manage baselines

The scan makes no changes to your database, is read-only, and appears in the Vulnerability Assessment tab.

### Perform an on-demand scan

1. From the resource's **Defender for Cloud** page, select **View additional findings in Vulnerability Assessment**.

1. Select **Scan**.

1. (Optional) Mark acceptable findings as baseline.

## View vulnerability assessment findings in Recommendations

SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings are available as security recommendations in the Microsoft Defender portal.

1. Go to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Exposure management** > **Recommendations**.
1. Select the **Cloud** tab.
1. Select **Misconfigurations**.
1. Add a filter:
   - **Scanner** = **SQL Vulnerability Assessment**

Select a recommendation to view details and remediation guidance.

## Review and remediate vulnerabilities

### Understand scan results

The vulnerability assessment report includes:

- An overview of your security state
- The number of issues found
- A severity summary of risks
- A list of findings for investigation

### Remediation and baseline procedure

1. Review scan results to identify security issues relevant to your environment.

1. Select each failed result to view detailed information.

1. Mark acceptable findings as baseline.

1. View Passed status for baseline-approved findings.

## Troubleshoot common issues

| Issue | Likely cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Scan results not visible | Missing viewer role | Ensure Security Admin or Security Reader role is assigned. |
| Can't change settings | Insufficient configuration role | Assign SQL Security Manager. |
| Baseline not reflected (classic) | New scan not run yet | Run another on-demand scan. |

## View vulnerability assessment findings in Recommendations

SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings are available as security recommendations in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

### [Assessment-based experience (Preview)](#tab/assessment)

In this experience, each SQL Vulnerability Assessment rule appears as an individual recommendation associated with the affected SQL database resource.

1. In **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, select **Recommendations**.
1. Ensure the **Recommendations by risk** view is selected.
1. Add a filter:
   - **Scanner** = **SQL Vulnerability Assessment**
1. Use:
   - **View by title** to group findings by recommendation.
   - **View per resource** to review findings per database.

### [Legacy (subassessment-based) experience](#tab/legacy)

In the legacy experience, SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings are shown as subassessments under broader SQL vulnerability assessment recommendations.

1. In **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, select **Recommendations**.
1. Open a SQL vulnerability assessment recommendation.
1. Select **View findings** to see individual rule results as subassessments.

## Review and remediate vulnerabilities

### Understand scan results

The vulnerability assessment report includes:

- An overview of your security state
- The number of issues found
- A severity summary of risks
- A list of findings for investigation

### Remediation and baseline procedure

1. Review scan results to identify security issues relevant to your environment.

1. Select each failed result to view detailed information.

1. Mark acceptable findings as baseline.

1. View Passed status for baseline-approved findings.
