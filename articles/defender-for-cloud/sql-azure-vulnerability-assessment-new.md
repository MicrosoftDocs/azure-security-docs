# Find and remediate SQL vulnerability assessment findings

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides [SQL Vulnerability Assessment](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md) for your Azure SQL databases. SQL Vulnerability A ssessment scans your databases for software vulnerabilities and provides a list of findings. Scan cycles help maintain a high security level and ensure compliance with organizational security policies. 

Use VA findings to fix software vulnerabilities and mark findings as baseline. You can run an on-demand vulnerability assessment scan to refresh and review the latest findings.

SQL vulnerability assessment is available in two configurations: **express** and **classic**. Both configurations use the same remediation workflow and baseline management. The only difference is the baseline approval timing. 

## Prerequisites

To review and remediate Vulnerability Assessment findings, make sure that:

- SQL Vulnerability Assessment is enabled on your Azure SQL resource.

- You have reviewed the required permissions and the data residency conditions:
    - [Express configuration](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md#express-configuration)
    - [Classic configuration](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md#classic-configuration)

- The Baseline approval timing is different per configuration model. If you aren't sure which Vulnerability Assesment configuration you are using, use the following steps to check:

    1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    1. Open your SQL Database resource.

    1. Under **Security** heading, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

    1. In the **Enablement Status**, select **Configure** to open the Microsoft Defender for SQL settings pane for either the entire server or managed instance.

  If the vulnerability settings show the option to configure a storage account, you're using the classic configuration. If not, you're using the express configuration.

## Run an on-demand scan

Run a read-only, on-demand Vulnerability Assessment scan to refresh findings instead of waiting for the next scheduled scan.

To run an on-demand scan:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Open your SQL Database resource.

1. Under the **Security** heading, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. Select **View additional findings in Vulnerability Assessment**.

1. Select **Scan**.

1. [Review and remediate vulnerabilities](#review-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings).

## Review and remediate Vulnerability Assessment findings

After a scan completes, the **Vulnerability Assessment** page shows a full view of your database security. This includes:

- An overview of your security state
- The number of issues found
- A severity summary of risks
- A list of findings for investigation

## Review and remediate vulnerabilities (Azure portal)

# [Database-level recommendations experience](#tab/database-level)

> [!NOTE]
> This experience is currently in preview. The previous [server-level experience](#review-and-remediate-vulnerabilities-azure-portal?tabs=server-level) using sub-assessments is still available.

In this experience:

- SQL vulnerability assessment findings follow the same recommendation structure used across Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Each SQL vulnerability assessment rule corresponds to its own recommendation.
- Recommendations are associated directly with the affected SQL database resource.
- Each rule can be reviewed, remediated, or marked as baseline independently.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to **Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Select the **Recommendations by risk** view.

1. Use the **Scanner** filter to view SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings.

1. Adjust the view: 
    - Use the **View per resource** filter to list all instances of the assessment per reported resources.
    - Use the **View by title** filter to aggregate all instances of the assessment under one value.

1. Review findings (**View by resource** only): 
    1. Select a recommendation.
    1. Review its description.
    1. Select **Manage query results and remediation** to review the query used for evaluating the recommendation, generate a remediation script, or set a baseline.
    1. Click on the resource name link for more information and actions.
    1. In the database’s **Resource health** page, review the recommendations generated on the resource, trigger a SQL VA scan, or go to the SQL VA scan history page. 

1. Review findings (**View by title** only): 
    1. Select a recommendation.
    1. Select **View remediation scripts** for an aggregated view of the types of remediation operations for all databases in scope.
    1. After reviewing, close the **Remediation scripts** side pane.
    1. Scroll to the right to reach the **Actions** column under **Affected resources**. 
    1. Select **Show query and results** for each affected database to setup baselines at scale.

# [Server-level (aggregated) experience](#tab/server-level)

In the server-level experience, SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings are shown as subassessments directly in the SQL Database resource.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Open your SQL Database resource.

1. Under the **Security** heading, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. Review scan results to identify security issues relevant to your environment.

1. Select an unhealthy finding to review details and remediation guidance.

1. View the **Passed** column for baseline-approved findings:
   - **Express:** Appears immediately without a new scan.
   - **Classic:** Requires running another on-demand scan.

## Troubleshoot common issues

Use this table to resolve common issues when working with SQL vulnerability assessment:

| Issue | Likely cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Scan results not visible | Missing viewer role | Ensure Security Admin or Security Reader role is assigned. |
| Can't change settings | Insufficient configuration role | Assign SQL Security Manager (and for classic: Owner + Storage Blob Data Reader on storage account). |
| Baseline not reflected (classic) | New scan not run yet | Run another on-demand scan to apply baseline changes. |
| Baseline not reflected (express) | Expectation mismatch | Baseline applies immediately; refresh the Vulnerability Assessment tab. |
| Access error opening email link (classic) | Storage role missing | Add Storage Blob Data Reader for the storage account containing scan results. |
