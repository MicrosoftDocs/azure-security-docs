# Find and remediate SQL vulnerability assessment findings

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides [SQL vulnerability assessment](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md) for your Azure SQL databases. SQL vulnerability assessment scans your databases for software vulnerabilities and provides a list of findings. Use the findings to fix software vulnerabilities and mark findings as baseline.

SQL vulnerability assessment is available in two configurations: **express** and **classic**. Some operational behavior (such as baseline timing) depends on the configuration model. For differences between these models, see [SQL vulnerability assessment overview](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md) 

## Prerequisites

- SQL vulnerability assessment is enabled on your Azure SQL resource.

- You have one of the following roles:
  - Security Admin
  - Security Reader
  - SQL Security Manager

## Run scans and manage baselines

The scan is read-only and appears in the **Vulnerability Assessment** tab of the SQL resource.

### Perform an on-demand scan

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Open your SQL resource.

1. Select **Defender for Cloud**.

1. Select **View additional findings in Vulnerability Assessment**.

1. Select **Scan**.

1. (Optional) Mark acceptable findings as baseline.

Baseline behavior depends on the configuration model. In the express configuration, approved findings are marked as Passed immediately. In the classic configuration, approved findings are marked as Passed after the next scan.

## Review and remediate vulnerabilities

1. Go to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).

1. Select **Exposure management** > **Recommendations**.

1. Select the **Cloud** tab.

1. Select **Misconfigurations**.

1. Use the **Scanner** filter to view SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings.

1. Select a recommendation to view details.

1. Review the finding details, including impact and remediation guidance.

1. Apply the recommended remediation in your SQL database.

1. If the finding is acceptable, mark it as baseline.

## View vulnerability assessment findings in Recommendations

# [Database-level recommendations experience (Preview)](#tab/database)

In this experience, each SQL Vulnerability Assessment rule appears as an individual recommendation associated with the affected SQL database resource.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to **Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Select the **Recommendations by risk** view.

1. Use the **Scanner** filter to view SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings.

1. Use the **View per resource** filter to review findings per database.

### [Server-level (aggregated) experience](#tab/server-level)

In the legacy experience, SQL Vulnerability Assessment findings are shown as subassessments under broader SQL vulnerability assessment recommendations.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to **Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Open a SQL vulnerability assessment recommendation.

1. Select **View findings** to review individual rule results as subassessments.

1. Select a failed finding to review details and remediation guidance.

1. Apply remediation or mark the finding as baseline.

## Troubleshoot common issues

| Issue | Likely cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Scan results not visible | Missing viewer role | Ensure Security Admin or Security Reader role is assigned. |
| Can't change settings | Insufficient configuration role | Assign SQL Security Manager. |
| Baseline not reflected (classic) | New scan not run yet | Run another on-demand scan. |
