# Enable vulnerability assessment powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability assessment powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, is an out-of-box solution that empowers security teams to easily discover and remediate vulnerabilities in container images, with zero configuration for onboarding, and without deployment of any sensors.

> [!NOTE]
> Some Azure cloud environments automatically enable vulnerability assessment and cannot be toggled. Refer to the [Defender for Containers support matrix](support-matrix-defender-for-containers.md?tabs=azureva#vulnerability-assessment-features) for more information.

## How to enable vulnerability assessment powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

1. Before starting, verify that the scope is [onboarded to Defender CSPM](tutorial-enable-cspm-plan.md), [Defender for Containers](tutorial-enable-containers-azure.md) or [Defender for Container Registries](defender-for-container-registries-introduction.md).
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Defender for Cloud's **Environment Settings** page.

1. Select the scope that's onboarded to one of the above plans. Then select **Settings**.

1. Ensure the **Agentless Container vulnerability assessments** extension is toggled to **On**.

1. Select **Continue**.

2. Select **Save**.

A notification message pops up in the top right corner that verifies that the settings were saved successfully.

## How to enable runtime coverage

- For Defender CSPM, use agentless discovery for Kubernetes. For more information, see [Onboard agentless container posture in Defender CSPM](how-to-enable-agentless-containers.md).
- For Defender for Containers, use agentless discovery for Kubernetes or use the Defender sensor. For more information, see [Enable the plan](defender-for-containers-enable.md).
- For Defender for Container Registries, there's no runtime coverage.
