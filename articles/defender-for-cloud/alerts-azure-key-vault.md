[Further details and notes](defender-for-key-vault-introduction.md)

### **Access from a suspicious IP address to a key vault**

(KV_SuspiciousIPAccess)

**Description**: A key vault has been successfully accessed by an IP that has been identified by Microsoft Threat Intelligence as a suspicious IP address. This might indicate that your infrastructure has been compromised. We recommend further investigation. Learn more about [Microsoft's threat intelligence capabilities](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence/).

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Credential Access

**Severity**: Medium

### **Access from a TOR exit node to a key vault**

(KV_TORAccess)

**Description**: A key vault has been accessed from a known TOR exit node. This could be an indication that a threat actor has accessed the key vault and is using the TOR network to hide their source location. We recommend further investigations.

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Credential Access

**Severity**: Medium

### **High volume of operations in a key vault**

(KV_OperationVolumeAnomaly)

**Description**: An anomalous number of key vault operations were performed by a user, service principal, and/or a specific key vault. This anomalous activity pattern might be legitimate, but it could be an indication that a threat actor has gained access to the key vault and the secrets contained within it. We recommend further investigations.

**[MITRE tactics](alerts-reference.md#mitre-attck-tactics)**: Credential Access

**Severity**: Medium

### **Suspicious policy change and secret query in a key vault**

(KV_PutGetAnomaly)

**Description**: A user or service principal has performed an anomalous Vault Put policy change operation followed by one or more Secret Get operations. This pattern is not normally performed by the specified user or service principal. This might be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has updated the key vault policy to access previously inaccessible secrets. We recommend further investigations.

**Description**: A user or service principal has performed an anomalous Secret List operation followed by one or more Secret Get operations. This pattern is not normally performed by the specified user or service principal and is typically associated with secret dumping. This might be legitimate activity, but it could be an indication that a threat actor  has gained access to the key vault and is trying to discover secrets that can be used to move laterally through your network and/or gain access to sensitive resources. We recommend further investigations.

**Severity**: Medium

### **Unusual access denied - User accessing high volume of key vaults denied**

(KV_AccountVolumeAccessDeniedAnomaly)

**Severity**: Low

### **Unusual access denied - Unusual user accessing key vault denied**

(KV_UserAccessDeniedAnomaly)

**Description**: A key vault access was attempted by a user that does not normally access it, this anomalous access pattern might be legitimate activity. Though this attempt was unsuccessful, it could be an indication of a possible attempt to gain access of key vault and the secrets contained within it.
