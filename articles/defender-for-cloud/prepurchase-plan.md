# Optimize Microsoft Defender for Cloud costs with a pre-purchase plan

You can save on your Microsoft Defender for Cloud costs when you prepurchase Microsoft Defender for Cloud commit units (DCU) for one year. You can use the prepurchased DCUs at any time during the purchase term. Unlike VMs, the prepurchased units don't expire on an hourly basis and you can use them at any time during the term of the purchase.

Any eligible Microsoft Defender for Cloud usage deducts from the prepurchased DCUs automatically. You don't need to redeploy or assign a pre-purchased plan to your Microsoft Defender for Cloud workspaces for the DCU usage to get the prepurchase discounts.

## Determine the right size to buy

A Defender for Cloud prepurchase applies to all Defender for Cloud plans. You can think of the prepurchase as a pool of prepaid Defender for Cloud commit units. Usage is deducted from the pool, regardless of the workload.

Thereâ€™s no ratio on which the DCUs are applied. DCUs are equivalent to the purchase currency value and are deducted at retail prices. Like other reservations, the benefit of a prepurchase plan is discounted pricing by committing to a purchase term. The more you buy, the larger the discount you receive.

For example, if you purchase 5,000 Commit Units for a one-year term, you get a 10% discount on Defender for Cloud products at this tier, so you pay only 4,500 USD. You can choose to use these units with Defender for Servers P2, and Defender CSPM plans on 20 Virtual machines (Azure VMs) for one year, which uses up 4800 Commit units.

As another example, an enterprise customer has an Annual Commitment Discount (ACD) of 10%. This customer typically consumes 120,000 USD worth of Microsoft Defender for Cloud at retail prices annually. With the ACD applied, their actual usage cost is 108,000 USD.

This year, the customer decided to purchase 100,000 Defender Credit Units (DCUs) for 82,000 USD, which includes an 18% discount off the retail prices. This discount isn't combined with the ACD, effectively making the actual discount rate 8%.

As DCUs are consumed at retail prices, the customer would still need to use 20,000 USD worth of Defender for Cloud at the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) rates, applying the ACD discount.

At the end of the commitment period, the actual Defender for Cloud usage cost for the customer would be 82,000 USD for the DCUs (reflecting the price with the 18% discount) plus 18,000 USD for the PAYG consumption (reflecting the 10% ACD discount). This totals to 100,000 USD.
