# Create interactive reports with Azure Monitor workbooks

[Azure workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview) are flexible canvas that you can use to analyze data and create rich, visual reports in the Azure portal. In workbooks, you can access multiple data sources across Azure. Combine workbooks into unified, interactive experiences.

Workbooks provide a rich set of capabilities for visualizing your Azure data. For detailed information about each visualization type, see the [visualizations examples and documentation](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-text-visualizations).

In Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can access built-in workbooks to track your organizationâ€™s security posture. You can also build custom workbooks to view a wide range of data from Defender for Cloud or other supported data sources.

For pricing, see the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/). You can also [estimate costs with the Defender for Cloud cost calculator](cost-calculator.md).

## Prerequisites

**Required roles and permissions**: To save a workbook, you must have at least [Workbook Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#workbook-contributor) permissions for the relevant resource group.

## Use Defender for Cloud gallery workbooks

In Defender for Cloud, you can use integrated Azure workbooks functionality to build custom, interactive workbooks that display your security data. Defender for Cloud includes a workbooks gallery that has the following workbooks ready for you to customize:

- [Coverage workbook](#coverage-workbook): Track the coverage of Defender for Cloud plans and extensions across your environments and subscriptions.
- [Secure Score Over Time workbook](#secure-score-over-time-workbook): Track your subscription scores and changes to recommendations for your resources.
- [System Updates workbook](#system-updates-workbook): View missing system updates by resource, OS, severity, and more.
- [Vulnerability Assessment Findings workbook](#vulnerability-assessment-findings-workbook): View the findings of vulnerability scans of your Azure resources.
- [Compliance Over Time workbook](#compliance-over-time-workbook): View the status of a subscription's compliance with regulatory standards or industry standards that you select.
- [Active Alerts workbook](#active-alerts-workbook): View active alerts by severity, type, tag, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, and location.
- Price Estimation workbook: View monthly, consolidated price estimations for plans in Defender for Cloud, based on the resource telemetry in your environment. The numbers are estimates that are based on retail prices and don't represent actual billing or invoice data.
- Governance workbook: Use the governance report in the governance rules settings to track progress of the rules that affect your organization.
- [DevOps Security (preview) workbook](#devops-security-workbook): View a customizable foundation that helps you visualize the state of your DevOps posture for the connectors that you set up.

Along with built-in workbooks, you can find useful workbooks in the **Community** category. These workbooks are provided as-is and have no SLA or support. You can choose one of the provided workbooks or create your own workbook.

### Coverage workbook

If you enable Defender for Cloud across multiple subscriptions and environments (Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform), you might find it challenging to keep track of which plans are active. It's especially true if you have multiple subscriptions and environments.

The Coverage workbook helps you keep track of which Defender for Cloud plans are active in which parts of your environments. This workbook can help you ensure that your environments and subscriptions are fully protected. By having access to detailed coverage information, you can identify areas that might need more protection so that you can take action to address those areas.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/coverage.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Coverage workbook, which displays the plans and extensions that are enabled in various subscriptions and environments." lightbox="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/coverage.png":::

In this workbook, you can select a subscription (or all subscriptions), and then view the following tabs:

- **Additional information**: Shows release notes and an explanation of each toggle.
- **Relative coverage**: Shows the percentage of subscriptions or connectors that have a specific Defender for Cloud plan enabled.
- **Absolute coverage**: Shows each plan's status per subscription.
- **Detailed coverage**: Shows additional settings that can be enabled or that must need to be enabled on relevant plans to get each plan's full value.

You also can select the Azure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud Platform environment in each or all subscriptions to see which plans and extensions are enabled for the environments.

### Secure Score Over Time workbook

The Secure Score Over Time workbook uses secure score data from your Log Analytics workspace. The data must be exported by using the continuous export tool as described in [Set up continuous export for Defender for Cloud in the Azure portal](continuous-export.md?tabs=azure-portal).

When you set up continuous export, under **Export frequency**, select both **Streaming updates** and **Snapshots (Preview)**.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/export-frequency-both.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the export frequency options to select for continuous export in the Secure Score Over Time workbook.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Snapshots are exported weekly. There's a delay of at least one week after the first snapshot is exported before you can view data in the workbook.

> [!TIP]
> To configure continuous export across your organization, use the provided `DeployIfNotExist` policies in Azure Policy that are described in [Set up continuous export at scale](continuous-export.md?tabs=azure-policy).

The Secure Score Over Time workbook has five graphs for the subscriptions that report to the selected workspaces:

### Active Alerts workbook

The Active Alerts workbook displays the active security alerts for your subscriptions on one dashboard. Security alerts are the notifications that Defender for Cloud generates when it detects threats against your resources. Defender for Cloud prioritizes and lists the alerts with the information that you need to quickly investigate and remediate.

This workbook benefits you by helping you be aware of and prioritize the active threats in your environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Most workbooks use Azure Resource Graph to query data. For example, to display a map view, data is queried in a Log Analytics workspace. [Continuous export](continuous-export.md) should be enabled. Export the security alerts to the Log Analytics workspace.

You can view active alerts by severity, resource group, and tag.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/active-alerts-pie-charts.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a sample view of the alerts viewed by severity, resource group, and tag.":::
