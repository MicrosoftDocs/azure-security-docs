# Modify Defender for Servers plan settings

After [deploying the Defender for Servers plan](tutorial-enable-servers-plan.md) in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can check whether resources are protected by Defender for Servers, configure a number of plan features, and turn the plan on and off as needed.

## Check feature status

Defender for Cloud provides you with the ability to check if your resources have Defender for Cloud enabled on them. Defender for Server settings for each resource are inherited by the subscription-level settings by default. Once you change settings at the resource level, the resource will no longer inherit settings from its parent subscription unless you delete the settings you configured.

1. In Defender for Cloud, select **Inventory**.

1. Locate the Defender for Cloud column:

You can also check the coverage for all of all your subscriptions and resources using the [Coverage workbook](custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks.md#coverage-workbook).


## Modify plan settings
