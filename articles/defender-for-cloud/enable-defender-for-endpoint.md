# Enable Defender for Endpoint integration

Microsoft Defender for Cloud [integrates natively with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) to provide Defender for Endpoint and Defender Vulnerability Management capabilities in Defender for Cloud.

- When you enable the Defender for Servers plan in Defender for Cloud, Defender for Endpoint integration is enabled by default.
- The integration automatically deploys the Defender for Endpoint agent on machines.

This article explains how to manually enable Defender for Endpoint integration when necessary.

## Prerequisites

**Requirement** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Windows support** | Verify that Windows machines are [supported by Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints#windows-server-2012-r2-and-windows-server-2016).
**Linux support** | For Linux servers, you must have Python installed. Python 3 is recommended for all distros, but is required for RHEL 8.x and Ubuntu 20.04 or higher.<br/><br/> Automatic deployment of the Defender for Endpoint sensor on Linux machines might not work as expected if machines run services that use [fanotify](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux#system-requirements). Manually install the Defender for Endpoint sensor on these machines.
**Azure VMs** |  Check that VMs can connect to the Defender for Endpoint service.<br/><br/> If machines don't have direct access, proxy settings or firewall rules need to allow access to Defender for Endpoint URLs. Review proxy settings for [Windows](/defender-endpoint/configure-proxy-internet) and [Linux](/defender-endpoint/linux-static-proxy-configuration) machines.
**On-premises VMs** | We recommend that you [onboard on-premises machines as Azure Arc-enabled VMs](/azure/azure-arc/servers/learn/quick-enable-hybrid-vm).<br/><br/> If you [onboard on-premises VMs directly](onboard-machines-with-defender-for-endpoint.md), Defender Server Plan 1 features are available, but most Defender for Servers Plan 2 functionality doesn't work.
**Azure tenant** | If you moved your subscription between Azure tenants, some manual preparatory steps are also required. [Contact Microsoft support](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview) for details.
**Windows Server 2016, 2012 R2** | Unlike later versions of Windows Server, which come with the Defender for Endpoint sensor preinstalled, Defender for Cloud installs the sensor on machines running Windows Server 2016/2012 R2 using the unified Defender for Endpoint solution. 

## Enable on a subscription

Defender for Endpoint integration is enabled by default when you enable a Defender for Servers plan. If you turn off the Defender for Endpoint integration on a subscription, you can turn it on again manually when necessary using these instructions.

1. In Defender for Cloud, select **Environment settings** and select the subscription containing the machines on which you want to deploy the Defender for Endpoint integration.

1. In **Settings and monitoring** > **Endpoint protection**, toggle the **Status** column settings to **On**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/integration-defender-for-endpoint/enable-defender-for-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Status toggle that enables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint." lightbox="media/integration-defender-for-endpoint/enable-defender-for-endpoint.png":::

1. Select **Continue** and **Save** to save your settings.

1. The Defender for Endpoint sensor is deployed to all Windows and Linux machines in the selected subscription.

    Onboarding might take up to an hour. Defender for Cloud detects any previous Defender for Endpoint installations and reconfigures them to integrate with Defender for Cloud.

### Verify installation on Linux machines

Verify Defender for Endpoint sensor installation on a Linux machine by following these steps:

1. Run the following shell command on each machine: `mdatp health`. If Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is installed, you see its health status:

    `healthy : true`

    `licensed: true`

1. Additionally, in the Azure portal, you can check that Linux machines have a new Azure extension called `MDE.Linux`.

> [!NOTE]
> On new subscriptions, Defender for Endpoint integration is automatically enabled and covers machines running a supported Windows Server or Linux operating system. The following sections cover a one-time opt-in that might be required in some scenarios only.


## Enable Defender for Endpoint unified solution on Windows Server 2016/2012 R2

If Defender for Servers is enabled and Defender for Endpoint integration is on in a subscription that existed before spring 2022, you might need to manually enable integration of the unified solution for machines running Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 R2 in the subscription.

1. In Defender for Cloud, select **Environment settings** and select the subscription with the Windows machines that you want to receive Defender for Endpoint.

1. In the Monitoring coverage column of the Defender for Servers plan, select **Settings**.

    The status of the Endpoint protections component is **Partial**, meaning that not all parts of the component are enabled.

1. Select **Fix** to see the components that aren't enabled.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/integration-defender-for-endpoint/fix-defender-for-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Fix button that enables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint support.":::

1. In **Missing components** > **Unified solution**, select **Enable** to automatically install the Defender for Endpoint agent on Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016 machines connected to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/integration-defender-for-endpoint/enable-defender-for-endpoint-unified.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enabling the use of the Defender for Endpoint unified solution for Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016 machines.":::

1. To save the changes, select **Save** at the top of the page. In the **Settings and monitoring** page, select **Continue**.

    Defender for Cloud onboards existing and new machines to Defender for Endpoint.

    Onboarding might take up to 12 hours. For new machines created after the integration has been enabled, onboarding takes up to an hour.

## Enable on Linux machines (plan/integration enabled)

If Defender for Servers is already enabled and Defender for Endpoint integration is on in the subscription, you can manually enable the integration for Linux machines in a subscription.

1. In Defender for Cloud, select **Environment settings** and select the subscription with the Linux machines that you want to receive Defender for Endpoint.

1. In the **Monitoring coverage** column of the Defender for Server plan, select **Settings**.

    The status of the **Endpoint protections** component is **Partial**, meaning that not all parts of the component are enabled.

1. Select **Fix** to see the components that aren't enabled.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/integration-defender-for-endpoint/fix-defender-for-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Fix button that enables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint support.":::

1. In **Missing components** > **Linux machines**, select **Enable**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/integration-defender-for-endpoint/enable-defender-for-endpoint-linux.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enabling the integration between Defender for Cloud and Microsoft's EDR solution, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux.":::

1. To save the changes, select **Save** at the top of the page. In the **Settings and monitoring** page, select **Continue**.

    - Defender for Cloud onboards Linux machines to Defender for Endpoint.
    - Defender for Cloud detects any previous Defender for Endpoint installations on Linux machines and reconfigures them to integrate with Defender for Cloud.
    - Onboarding might take up to 12 hours. For new machines created after the integration has been enabled, onboarding takes up to an hour.

1. To verify Defender for Endpoint sensor installation on a Linux machine, run the following shell command on each machine.

    `mdatp health`

    If Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is installed, you see its health status:

    `healthy : true`

    `licensed: true`

1. In the Azure portal, you can check that Linux machines have a new Azure extension called `MDE.Linux`.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Defender for Endpoint integration on Linux machines is a one-time action. If you disable the plan and re-enable it, integration remains enabled.

## Enable integration on Linux in multiple subscriptions

1. In Defender for Cloud, open the **Workload protections** dashboard.
1. In the dashboard, review the insights panel to see which subscriptions and resources don't have Defender for Endpoint enabled for Linux machines.

    - The insights panel displays information about subscriptions that have integration enabled for Windows machines but not for Linux machines.
    - Subscriptions without Linux machines show no affected resources.

1. In the insights panel, select the subscriptions on which to enable Defender for Endpoint integration for Linux machines.
1. Select **Enable** to turn on endpoint protection for Linux machines. Defender for Cloud:

    - Automatically onboards Linux machines to Defender for Endpoint in the selected subscriptions.
    - Detects any previous installations of Defender for Endpoint and reconfigures them to integrate with Defender for Cloud.

Use the [Defender for Servers deployment status workbook](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Workbooks/Defender%20for%20Servers%20Deployment%20Status). Among other things in this workbook, you can verify installation and deployment status of Defender for Endpoint on a Linux machine.

### Manage automatic updates for Linux

In Windows, Defender for Endpoint version updates are provided via continuous knowledge base updates. In Linux, you need to update the Defender for Endpoint package.

- When you use Defender for Servers with the `MDE.Linux` extension, automatic updates for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint are enabled by default.
- If you want to manage version updates manually, you can disable automatic updates on your machines. To do this, add the following tag for machines onboarded with the `MDE.Linux` extension.

  - Tag name: `ExcludeMdeAutoUpdate`
  - Tag value: `true`

This configuration is supported for Azure VMs and Azure Arc machines, where the `MDE.Linux` extension initiates autoupdate.

## Enable integration with PowerShell on multiple subscriptions

To enable endpoint protection on Linux machines and Windows machines running Windows Server 2016/2012 R2 in multiple subscriptions, use our [PowerShell script](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Powershell%20scripts/MDE%20Integration/Enable%20MDE%20Integration%20for%20Linux) from the Defender for Cloud GitHub repository.

## Enable integration at scale

You can enable the Defender for Endpoint integration at scale through the supplied REST API version 2022-05-01. For full details, see the [API documentation](/rest/api/defenderforcloud-composite/settings/update?view=rest-defenderforcloud-composite-latest&tabs=HTTP&preserve-view=true).

Here's an example request body for the PUT request to enable the Defender for Endpoint integration:

URI: `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microsoft.Security/settings/WDATP?api-version=2022-05-01`

```json
{
    "name": "WDATP",
    "type": "Microsoft.Security/settings",
    "kind": "DataExportSettings",
    "properties": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

## Track Defender for Endpoint deployment status

You can use the [Defender for Endpoint deployment status workbook](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Workbooks/Defender%20for%20Servers%20Deployment%20Status) to track the Defender for Endpoint deployment status on your Azure VMs and Azure Arc-enabled VMs. The interactive workbook provides an overview of machines in your environment showing their Microsoft Defender for Endpoint extension deployment status.

## Access the Defender portal

1. Make sure you have the [right permissions for portal access](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/assign-portal-access).

1. Check whether you have a proxy or firewall that is blocking anonymous traffic.

    - The Defender for Endpoint sensor connects from the system context, so anonymous traffic must be permitted.
    - To ensure unhindered access to the Defender for Endpoint portal, [enable access to service URLs in the proxy server](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-proxy-internet#enable-access-to-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server).

1. Open the [Microsoft Defender Portal](https://security.microsoft.com/). Learn about [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-mde).

## Send a test alert from Defender for Endpoint

To generate a benign test alert from Defender for Endpoint, select the tab for the relevant operating system of your endpoint:

### Test on Windows

For endpoints running Windows:

1. Create a folder 'C:\test-MDATP-test'.
1. Use Remote Desktop to access your machine.
1. Open a command-line window.
1. At the prompt, copy and run the following command. The command prompt window closes automatically.

    ```powershell
    powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'); Start-Process 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="./media/integration-defender-for-endpoint/generate-edr-alert.png" alt-text="A command prompt window with the command to generate a test alert.":::

    If the command is successful, you see a new alert on the workload protection dashboard and the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal. This alert might take a few minutes to appear.
