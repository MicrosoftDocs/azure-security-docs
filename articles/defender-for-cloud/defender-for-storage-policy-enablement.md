# Enable and configure at scale with an Azure built-in policy

Defender for Storage should be enabled via a built-in policy. This method facilitates enablement at scale and ensures a consistent security policy is applied across all existing and future storage accounts within the defined scope, such as entire management groups. This keeps the storage accounts protected with Defender for Storage according to the organization's defined configuration.

> [!TIP]
> You can always [configure specific storage accounts](/azure/storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdefender-for-cloud%2Ftoc.json&tabs=enable-subscription#override-defender-for-storage-subscription-level-settings) with custom configurations that differ from the settings configured at the subscription level (override subscription-level settings).

## Azure built-in policy

To enable and configure Defender for Storage at scale with an Azure built-in policy, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to the **Policy** dashboard.
1. In the Policy dashboard, select **Definitions** from the left-side menu.
1. In the "Security Center" category, search for and then select **Configure Microsoft Defender for Storage to be enabled**. This policy enables all Defender for Storage capabilities: Activity monitoring, Malware scanning, and Sensitive data threat detection. You can also get it here: [List of built-in policy definitions](/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#security-center). If you want to enable a policy without the configurable features, use **Configure basic Microsoft Defender for Storage to be enabled (Activity Monitoring only)**.

> Malware scanning can be configured to send scanning results to the following: <br>  **Event Grid custom topic** - for near-real time automatic response based on every scanning result.
