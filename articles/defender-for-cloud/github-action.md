# Configure the Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub action

Microsoft Security DevOps is a command line application that integrates static analysis tools into the development lifecycle. Security DevOps installs, configures, and runs the latest versions of static analysis tools such as, SDL, security and compliance tools. Security DevOps is data-driven with portable configurations that enable deterministic execution across multiple environments.

Microsoft Security DevOps uses the following Open Source tools:

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

- [Connect your GitHub repositories](quickstart-onboard-github.md).

- Open the [Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/security-devops-action) in a new window.

- Ensure that [Workflow permissions are set to Read and Write](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-repository) on the GitHub repository. This includes setting "id-token: write" permissions in the GitHub Workflow for federation with Defender for Cloud.
