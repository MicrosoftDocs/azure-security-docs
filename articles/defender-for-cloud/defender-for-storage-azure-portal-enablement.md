# Enable and configure with the Azure portal

We recommend that you enable Defender for Storage on the subscription level. Doing so ensures all storage accounts currently in the subscription will be protected. Storage accounts that are created after enabling Defender for Storage on the subscription level will be protected up to 24 hours after creation.

> [!TIP]
> You can always [configure specific storage accounts](/azure/storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdefender-for-cloud%2Ftoc.json&tabs=enable-subscription.md#override-defender-for-storage-subscription-level-settings) with custom configurations that differ from the settings configured at the subscription level (override subscription-level settings).

## [Enable on a subscription (recommended)](#tab/enable-subscription/)

To enable Defender for Storage at the subscription level using the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**.
1. Select the subscription for which you want to enable Defender for Storage.

1. Select the three dots on the right and then choose the **Edit settings** option.
1. On the Defender plans page, locate **Storage** in the list and select **On** and **Save**. If you currently have Defender for Storage enabled with per-transaction pricing, select the **New pricing plan available** link and confirm the pricing change.

Microsoft Defender for Storage is now enabled for this subscription, and is fully protected, including on-upload malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection.

If you want to turn off the on-upload malware scanning or sensitive data threat detection, you can select **Settings** and change the status of the relevant feature to **Off** and save the changes.

If you want to change the malware scanning size capping per storage account per month for malware, change the settings in **Edit configuration** and save the changes.

If you want to disable the plan, turn status button to **Off** for the Storage plan on the Defender plans page and save the changes.

## [Enable on a storage account](#tab/enable-storage-account/)

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage for a specific account using the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
1. Navigate to your storage account.
In the storage account menu, in the **Security + networking** section, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
1. On-upload Malware Scanning and Sensitive data threat detection are enabled by default. You can disable the features by unselecting them.
1. Select  **Enable on storage account**. Microsoft Defender for Storage is now enabled on this storage account.

    > [!TIP]
