# Use the data ingestion benefit

When you enable Defender for Servers Plan 2 in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you take advantage of 500 MB of free data ingestion daily. Here's how it works.

- Defender for Servers Plan 2 provides an allowance of 500 MB per node daily for specific security data types directly collected by Defender for Cloud.
- Data ingestion is calculated per machine, per reported workspace, and daily.
- The total daily free limit equals [number of machines] x 500 MB.
- The allowance is a daily rate averaged across all machines.
- You don't get charged extra if the total doesn't exceed your daily free limit, even if some machines send 100 MB and others send 800 MB.
- The benefit is granted to the Log Analytics workspace where the machine reports.
- The benefit might not appear on your invoice, since it has zero cost. The benefit is visible in the product and in exports from Microsoft Cost Management. Learn how to  [view your data allocation benefits](/azure/azure-monitor/fundamentals/cost-usage#view-data-allocation-benefits).

## Prerequisites

- Every machine running the Azure Monitor agent (AMA) in a subscription with Defender for Servers Plan 2 enabled gets the benefit.
- Every workspace where machines report must have Defender for Servers Plan 2 enabled.
- Every machine reporting to more than one workspace gets the benefit granted to only one of them.

The following subset of  [security data types](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables-category#security) are supported for the benefit:

- [SecurityAlert](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securityalert)
- [SecurityBaseline](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitybaseline)
- [SecurityBaselineSummary](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitybaselinesummary)
- [SecurityDetection](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitydetection)
- [SecurityEvent](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securityevent)
- [WindowsFirewall](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/windowsfirewall)
- [ProtectionStatus](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/protectionstatus)
- [Update](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/update) and [UpdateSummary](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/updatesummary) when the Update Management solution isn't running in the workspace or solution targeting is enabled.
- [MDCFileIntegrityMonitoringEvents](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/mdcfileintegritymonitoringevents)
- [WindowsEvent](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/windowsevent?branch=main)
- [LinuxAuditLog](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/linuxauditlog)

### Create a custom Data Collection Rule (DCR) for Security Events (500 MB/day benefit)

Security Events are free—up to **500 MB per server per day** only when they reach the **SecurityEvent** table.  A DCR must therefore use the **Microsoft-SecurityEvent** stream to ensure compliance with the data ingestion benefit.

#### Quick steps to create a DCR

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) ▸ *Monitor* ▸ **Data Collection Rules** ▸ **+ Create**.
2. **Add data source**  
   - *Type*: **Windows event logs**  
   - *Log name*: `Security`  
   - *Stream*: **`Microsoft-SecurityEvent`**  
   - *(Optional)* filter with XPath, for example:

     ```xpath
     *[System[(EventID=4624 or EventID=4625 or EventID=4688)]]
     ```

3. **Destination** ▸ Select the Log Analytics workspace that has **Defender for Servers Plan 2** enabled.
4. **Review + create** ▸ **Assign** the rule to Windows machines running the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA).

#### Sample JSON fragment

```json
{
  "dataSources": {
    "windowsEventLogs": [
      {
        "name": "SecurityEvents",
        "streams": ["Microsoft-SecurityEvent"],
        "scheduledTransferPeriod": "PT5M",
        "xPathQueries": [
          "*[System[(EventID=4624 or EventID=4625 or EventID=4688)]]"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "destinations": {
    "logAnalytics": [
      { "workspaceId": "<workspace-id>" }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Compliance checklist

| Requirement | Why it matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **`Microsoft-SecurityEvent`** stream in the DCR | Routes data to the **SecurityEvent** table covered by the allowance. |
| **Security solution** enabled on workspace | Activates the SecurityEvent table. |
| **Defender for Servers Plan 2** | Grants the daily 500 MB allowance per node. |
| **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** installed | Required to apply custom DCRs. |

#### Deploy at scale

Automate creation and assignment of a compliant DCR across subscriptions with the Azure Policy initiative [Deploy AMA DCR for Security Events collection](
https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Policy/Deploy%20AMA%20DCR%20for%20Security%20Events%20collection).

## Configure a workspace

Azure Monitor describes how to [create a Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace).

## Enable Defender for Servers Plan 2 on the workspace

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. In the Defender for Cloud menu, select **Environment settings**, and select the relevant workspace.

1. Select the relevant workspace.

1. Toggle the servers plan to **On**, and then select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to disable Defender for Servers Plan 2, you explicitly disable the plan on any Log Analytics workspace with it enabled.
