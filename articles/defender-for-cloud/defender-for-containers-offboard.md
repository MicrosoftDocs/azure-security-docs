# Offboarding Microsoft Defender for Containers resources 

When you enable Defender for Containers capabilities that use automatic provisioning, or use recommendations to manually deploy container capabilities on specific resources, Defender components, and extensions are installed in your environment. To help you keep track of these components, we provide tables in the subsequent sections of this article. These tables show the Defender for Clouds feature and its installed Defender for Container components, extensions, and roles.

If you decide to stop using those capabilities, you might also want to remove such components from your environment. This article assists you in understanding the actions that can be taken to remove them.

The components and roles fall under two removal-type categories:

- **Safe to remove** - Resources and settings exclusively used by Defender for Containers, and can be safely removed if you're no longer using the associated capability.
- **Shared component** - Resources might be used by non-Defender for Cloud solutions or by other Defender for Cloud solutions in the target cloud environment. If a shared resource is disabled, the other solutions might be negatively affected. Before removing, you should review if other solutions in that cloud environment need the resource before removing it.
