# Vulnerability assessment for the JFrog Artifactory (Cloud) external registry with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

Microsoft Defender for Containers provides inventory discover, security posture evaluation, and vulnerability assessment of a container image throughout its lifecycle, from code development to cloud deployment. JFrog Artifactory (Cloud) container registry is widely used, and supported by Defender for Containers with the same security capabilities available for cloud-native registries such as Azure Container Registry (ACR), Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Google Container Registry (GCR). 

## Functionality

**Inventory** – Identifies and lists all available container images within the JFrog Artifactory tenant.

**Vulnerability Assessment** – Regularly scans the JFrog Artifactory tenant for supported container images, identifies vulnerabilities, and provides recommendations for issues to be addressed.

## Prerequisites

To enable vulnerability assessment for your JFrog Artifactory, a JFrog connector must be configured. The JFrog connector generates a script to execute in the JFrog environment using the [JFrog CLI](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli). The generated script can run from a Windows, Linux, or macOS environment.

The following are prerequisites to generate execute the script:

- You must have administrative access to your Jfrog Artifactory tenant.
- The [JFrog CLI must be installed](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/install).
- The [jq JSON parser must be installed](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

## Onboarding of JFrog Artifactory environment

You must have "Security administrator" or "Global administration" privileges in Microsoft Defender for Cloud to add a new JFrog Artifactory as an environment.

 > [!NOTE]
> Each connector corresponds to only one JFrog Artifactory tenant. You must create a connector for each tenant that is to have security coverage.

**The JFrog environment wizard assists with the onboarding process:**

1. Connector Details

    :::image type="content" source="media/agentless-vulnerability-assessment-jfrog-artifactory/2-connector-details.jpg" lightbox="media/agentless-vulnerability-assessment-jfrog-artifactory/2-connector-details.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the JFrog wizard showing the JFrog connector fields to populate.":::

    **Connector name:** Specify a unique connector name.
   
    **Location:** Specify the geographic location where Defender for Cloud stores the data associated with this connector.
   
    **Subscription:** The hosting subscription that defines the RBAC scope, and billing entity for the JFrog Artifactory environment.
   
    **Resource group:** for RBAC purposes.
        
    **Scanning intervals:**  Set the container registry scan interval with hourly precision.
   
    **Server ID:** A prefix of the customer's JFrog Artifactory account URL. Example: **MYSERVERID** is the server ID of **https://MYSERVERID.jfrog.io/** 

> [!NOTE]
> A single subscription can be linked to one JFrog Artifactory environment instance, although container images from this instance may be deployed to multiple environments that are overseen by Defender for Cloud, outside the boundaries of the associated subscription.

1. Select Plans
   
     Multiple plans exist for this environment. Select the desired plan:

    **Foundational CSPM:** Basic plan available for all customers, provides inventory capabilities only.
    
    **Containers:** Offers inventory and vulnerability assessment features.  
    
    **Defender CSPM:** Offers inventory and vulnerability assessment features, plus extra capabilities like attack path analysis and code-to-cloud mapping.
    
    > [!NOTE] 
    > For information regarding the plan pricing review [Microsoft Defender for Cloud pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).  
    > Ensure your JFrog Artifactory environment plans are in sync with your cloud environment plans and share the same subscription to maximize coverage.
    
1. Configure Access

    To maintain a continuous and secure link between Defender for Containers and your JFrog Artifactory tenant, you need to execute a connection script via Jfrog CLI.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > Each JFrog Artifactory connector corresponds to one JFrog Artifactory tenant.
    > Therefore, onboard a separate JFrog Artifactory environment Connector in Defender for Cloud for each JFrog Artifactory tenant you're administrating to achieve optimal security coverage for your container software supply chain.
    
    Download the relevant installation script, based on the operating system of the environment from which you intend to run the connector script (**Windows**, or **Linux/macOS** )

Execute the connector script using the [Jfrog CLI.](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli)

1. Review and generate

Review all the configured connector details before generating the JFrog connector.
