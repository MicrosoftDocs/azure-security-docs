# Alerts for Linux machines

This article lists the security alerts you might get for Linux machines from Microsoft Defender for Cloud and any Microsoft Defender plans you enabled. The alerts shown in your environment depend on the resources and services you're protecting, and your customized configuration.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the recently added alerts powered by Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint might be undocumented.

[Learn how to respond to these alerts](manage-respond-alerts.md).

[Learn how to export alerts](continuous-export.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts from different sources might take different amounts of time to appear. For example, alerts that require analysis of network traffic might take longer to appear than alerts related to suspicious processes running on virtual machines.

> [!NOTE]
> VM client boot attestation alerts surfaced in Microsoft Defender for Cloud are informational and are not currently presented in the Defender portal.
