# Enable vulnerability scanning

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides vulnerability scanning with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, to scan machines for software inventory and vulnerabilities, and provide findings and insights in Defender for Cloud.

[Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management) is integrated by default into Defender for Servers, along with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

When you enable a Defender for Servers plan, vulnerability scanning is available by default, either with agentless scanning, or because Defender for Servers is configured to automatically provision the Defender for Endpoint agent on connected machines.

- Defender for Servers Plan 2 provides vulnerability scanning as part of [agentless machine scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md), as well as agent-based scanning using the integrated Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent. [Learn more](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) about the integration.
- Defender for Servers Plan 1 provides agent-based scanning only.


## Prerequisites
- Review [supported machines](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-supported-os)
- Make sure you have a [Defender for Servers plan enabled](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features). 
- The plan must have [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration enabled](enable-defender-for-endpoint.md)|
You need [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) (resource group level) permissions to deploy the scanner
You need [Security Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-reader) to view findings.

## Manually configure vulnerability scanning on a subscription

1. In Defender for Cloud, open **Environment settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription.
1. In the Monitoring coverage column of the Defender for Servers plan, select **Settings**.

1. In **Settings and monitoring**, turn on **Vulnerability assessment for machines** as needed.
1. Select **Edit configuration** to select a solution.

1. Select **Apply** > **Save**.

### Configure with REST API

To configure with the REST API,  run PUT/DELETE using this URL: 

`https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/.../providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessments/mdetvm?api-version=2015-06-01-preview`


## Manually configure vulnerability scanning for a machine

If you want to enable vulnerability scanning for a specific machine, use the recommendation that's issued if Defender for Servers doesn't find a vulnerability assessment solution on a machine.

1. To manually enable vulnerability scanning for a machine, open the recommendation "[Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ffff0522-1e88-47fc-8382-2a80ba848f5d)".
1. Follow the recommendation remediation steps to fix machines that don't have a vulnerability assessment solution enabled.
1. Select a vulnerability solution.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management/mdvm-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the window that shows the options for selecting a vulnerability assessment solution from the recommendation.":::

> [!Tip]
> To find all machines with this recommendation,in the **Inventory** page, select **Unhealthy resources**. Use the **Recommendations** filter to search for machines with this recommendation

After the process completes, it can take up to 24 hours until resources move to the **Healthy resources** tab.
