# Enable vulnerability scanning

The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides [vulnerability scanning](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md) for protected machines.

Integrated vulnerability scanning in Defender for Cloud uses Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management and provides both [agentless and agent-based](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md#agent-based-and-agentless-scanning) scanning.

Vulnerability management is enabled by default when you enable Defender for Servers. Use the instructions in this article if you need to enable vulnerability scanning manually.

## Prerequisites

**Requirement** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Agentless vulnerability scanning** | Review [agentless scanning requirements](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#prerequisites).<br/><br/> Agentless vulnerability scanning is available and turned on by default when either Defender for Servers Plan 2 or the Defender for Servers Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) plan is enabled.
**Agent-based vulnerability scanning** | For agent-based vulnerability scanning, Defender Servers Plan 1 or 2 must be enabled.
**Machine support** | Review [supported machines](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-supported-os).
**Permissions** | You need [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)  (resource group level) permissions to deploy the scanner.<br/><br/> You need [Security Reader](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#security-reader)  to view findings.

## Enable vulnerability scanning on a subscription

1. In Defender for Cloud, open **Environment settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription.
1. In the Monitoring coverage column of the Defender for Servers plan, select **Settings**.

1. In **Settings and monitoring**, turn on **Vulnerability assessment for machines** as needed.
1. Select **Edit configuration** to select an assessment solution.

1. Select **Apply** > **Save**.

### Configure with the REST API

To configure with the REST API, run PUT/DELETE using this URL:

`https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/.../providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessments/mdetvm?api-version=2015-06-01-preview`

## Enable vulnerability scanning for a machine

To enable vulnerability scanning for a specific machine, use the recommendation issued if Defender for Servers doesn't find a vulnerability assessment solution installed on the machine.

1. To find all machines without a solution installed, in the **Inventory** page, select **Unhealthy resources**. Use the **Recommendations** filter to search for machines with this recommendation: `Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution`.
1. Open the recommendation.
1. Follow the recommendation remediation steps to fix machines that don't have a vulnerability assessment solution enabled.
1. Select a vulnerability solution.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management/mdvm-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the window that shows the options for selecting a vulnerability assessment solution from the recommendation.":::

After the process completes, it can take up to 24 hours for resources to move to the **Healthy resources** tab.
