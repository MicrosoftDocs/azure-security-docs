# Enable vulnerability scanning

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides [vulnerability scanning with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md), to scan machines for software inventory and vulnerabilities, and provide findings and insights in Defender for Cloud.

When you enable a [Defender for Servers](defender-for-servers-overview.md) plan, vulnerability scanning is available by default, and is provided by [agentless machine scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md), or agent-based scanning using the integrated Defender for Endpoint sensor in Defender for Cloud

## Prerequisites

- For agentless vulnerability scanning, agentless scanning must be enabled in Defender for Servers Plan 2.
    - It's enabled by default when you enable Plan 2.
    - Agentless vulnerability scanning is also available when you enable the Defender for Servers Cloud Security Posture Managmeent (CSPM) plan.
- For agent-based vulnerability scanning, Defender Servers Plan 1 or 2 must be enabled with [Defender for Endpoint integration](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) .
- 
- [Review requirements](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#prerequisites) for enabling agentless scanning.
- [Review machines supported](/defender-endpoint/tvm-supported-os) for vulnerability scanning with Defender for Vulnerability Management.
You need [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) (resource group level) permissions to deploy the scanner.
You need [Security Reader](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#security-reader) to view findings.

## Manually configure vulnerability scanning on a subscription

1. In Defender for Cloud, open **Environment settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription.
1. In the Monitoring coverage column of the Defender for Servers plan, select **Settings**.

1. In **Settings and monitoring**, turn on **Vulnerability assessment for machines** as needed.
1. Select **Edit configuration** to select an assessment solution.

1. Select **Apply** > **Save**.


### Configure with the REST API

To configure with the REST API,  run PUT/DELETE using this URL: 

`https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/.../providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessments/mdetvm?api-version=2015-06-01-preview`


## Manually configure vulnerability scanning for a machine

To enable vulnerability scanning for a specific machine, use the recommendation that's issued if Defender for Servers doesn't find a vulnerability assessment solution installed on a machine.

1. To find all machines without a solution installed, in the **Inventory** page, select **Unhealthy resources**. Use the **Recommendations** filter to search for machines with this recommendation `Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution`.
1. Open the recommendation.
1. Follow the recommendation remediation steps to fix machines that don't have a vulnerability assessment solution enabled.
1. Select a vulnerability solution.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management/mdvm-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the window that shows the options for selecting a vulnerability assessment solution from the recommendation.":::

After the process completes, it can take up to 24 hours until resources move to the **Healthy resources** tab.
