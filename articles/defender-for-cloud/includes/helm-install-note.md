> **Deploying the Defender sensor using Helm**: Unlike other options that are autoprovisioned and updated automatically, Helm lets you flexibly deploy the Defender sensor. This approach is especially useful in DevOps and infrastructure-as-code scenarios. With Helm, you can integrate deployment into CI/CD pipelines and control all sensor updates. You can also choose to receive preview and GA versions. For instructions on installing the Defender sensor using Helm, see [Install Defender for Containers sensor using Helm](../deploy-helm.md).
