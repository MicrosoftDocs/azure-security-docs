> As of August 1, 2023, customers with an existing subscription to Defender for DNS can continue to use the service as a standalone plan.
> For new subscriptions, alerts about suspicious DNS activity are included as part of Defender for Servers Plan 2 (P2).
> There's no change to the protection scope: Defender for DNS continues to protect all Azure resources connected to Azure's default DNS resolvers. The change affects how DNS protection is billed and bundled, not what resources are covered.
