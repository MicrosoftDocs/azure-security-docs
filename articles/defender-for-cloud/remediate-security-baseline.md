# Remediate security baseline recommendations powered by MDVM

Microsoft Defender for Cloud enhances the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks by providing security baselines that are powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM). These security baselines help you secure your servers by providing recommendations that improve your security posture.

MDVM's security baselines features extensive coverage of benchmarks, which are continuously updated, along with comprehensive rule coverage. Each rule is accompanied with information that details the effect of the issue, a description of the problem, and detailed recommendation steps. These checks are integrated into the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) agent, which allows Defender for Cloud to provide extra security checks within the same agent.
