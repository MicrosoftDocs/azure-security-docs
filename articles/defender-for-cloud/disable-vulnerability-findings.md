# Disable vulnerability findings

The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud uses [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md) to continuously scan your virtual machines (VMs) and identify vulnerabilities. Defender for Servers presents the vulnerability findings as recommendations. Each recommendation includes remediation steps, related CVEs, and CVSS scores. You can recommendations findings across subscriptions or for a specific VM.

If your organization needs to ignore certain findings instead of remediating them, you can disable them with a rule. Disabled findings don't affect your secure score, generate noise, or appear in the list of findings.

You might disable findings for:
- Vulnerabilities with a severity less than *Medium*
- Non-patchable vulnerabilities
- Vulnerabilities with a CVSS score below 6.5
- Findings that contain specific text in the security check or category (for example, “Red Hat”)

## Prerequisites

- [Vulnerability scanning](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md) must be enabled.
- To create a rule to ignore findings, you need permissions to edit a policy in [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview#azure-rbac-permissions-in-azure-policy).
- [View vulnerability assessment findings](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md) before you start.

## Disable specific findings

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to **Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Find the recommendation **[Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1195afff-c881-495e-9bc5-1486211ae03f)**.

1. On the recommendation details page, select the **Take action** tab, and then select **Disable rule**.

1. In the **Disable rule** pane, specify the criteria for the findings you want to disable. You can specify:
   - **IDs** – Enter one or more finding IDs (separate multiple IDs with semicolons).
   - **CVEs** – Enter CVE identifiers for the findings you want to disable.
   - **Categories** – Enter the categories of findings to disable.
   - **Security checks** – Enter text from the security check name for findings to disable.
   - **CVSS2 and CVSS3 scores** – To filter by score, enter a value between 1 and 10.
   - **Minimum severity** – Select *Medium* or *High* to exclude findings with a lower severity.
   - **Patchable status** – Select this option to exclude findings that can't be patched.

1. Optionally, add a justification, and then select **Apply rule**. The rule might take up to 24 hours to take effect.

1. To view the rule status, open the **Disable rule** page. In the **Scope** list, subscriptions with active findings show the status **Rule applied**.
