# Investigating risk with security explorer/attack paths

> [!VIDEO https://aka.ms/docs/player?id=36a5c440-00e6-4bd8-be1f-a27fbd007119]

One of the biggest challenges that security teams face today is the number of security issues they face on a daily basis. There are numerous security issues that need to be resolved and never enough resources to address them all.

Defender for Cloud's contextual security capabilities assists security teams to assess the risk behind each security issue, and identify the highest risk issues that need to be resolved soonest. Defender for Cloud assists security teams to reduce the risk of an impactful breach to their environment in the most effective way.

All of these capabilities are available as part of the [Defender Cloud Security Posture Management](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) plan and require you to enable either [agentless scanning for VMs](concept-agentless-data-collection.md) or the [vulnerability assessment capability](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm.md) on the [Defender for Servers plan](apply-security-baseline.md).

## What is cloud security graph?

The cloud security graph is a graph-based context engine that exists within Defender for Cloud. The cloud security graph collects data from your multicloud environment and other data sources. For example, the cloud assets inventory, connections and lateral movement possibilities between resources, exposure to internet, permissions, network connections, vulnerabilities, and more. The data collected is then used to build a graph representing your multicloud environment.

Defender for Cloud then uses the generated graph to perform an attack path analysis and find the issues with the highest risk that exist within your environment. You can also query the graph using the cloud security explorer.

## What is attack path analysis?

Attack path analysis is a graph-based algorithm that scans the cloud security graph. The scans expose exploitable paths that attackers might use to breach your environment to reach your high-impact assets. Attack path analysis exposes attack paths and suggests recommendations as to how best remediate issues that break the attack path and prevent successful breach.

When you take your environment's contextual information into account, attack path analysis identifies issues that might lead to a breach on your environment, and helps you to remediate the highest risk ones first. For example its exposure to the internet, permissions, lateral movement, and more.

Defender for Cloud offers a dynamic attack path analysis that is based on each customers individual cloud security graph. Attack paths are unique for each individual customer and the analysis performed by Defender for Cloud is updated in real-time as new data is collected from your multicloud environments. Unlike other products that offer attack path analysis, Defender for Cloud doesn't rely on static rules or predefined attack paths. Instead, it uses a graph-based algorithm that is unique to each customer's environment to provide the most accurate and up-to-date attack path analysis for each customer's environment.

## What is cloud security explorer?

By running graph-based queries on the cloud security graph with the cloud security explorer, you can proactively identify security risks in your multicloud environments. Your security team can use the query builder to search for and locate risks, while taking your organization's specific contextual and conventional information into account.

Cloud security explorer provides you with the ability to perform proactive exploration features. You can search for security risks within your organization by running graph-based path-finding queries on top the contextual security data that is already provided by Defender for Cloud, such as cloud misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, resource context, lateral movement possibilities between resources and more.
