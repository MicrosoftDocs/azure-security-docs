# On-demand malware scanning

*On-demand malware scanning** in Microsoft Defender for Storage enables you to scan existing blobs in your Azure Storage accounts whenever needed. This capability provides flexibility to scan stored data in response to evolving security requirements, compliance needs, or security incidents, ensuring your data is continuously protected.

By using Microsoft Defender Antivirus with the latest malware definitions, on-demand scanning offers a cloud-native solution. It doesn't require further infrastructure or operational overhead. This approach addresses gaps in coverage, especially for data uploaded before scanning was enabled. It also helps when new threats emerge, allowing you to proactively secure stored files and reduce potential exposure in cloud environments.

## Benefits of on-demand scanning

Using on-demand malware scanning in Microsoft Defender for Storage offers the following advantages:

- **Respond to security events:** Immediately scan storage accounts when security alerts or suspicious activities are detected.
- **Ensure compliance:** Run scheduled or on-demand scans to meet data protection and regulatory compliance requirements.
- **Proactive security management:** Set recurring scans to maintain a continuously secure environment.
- **Create a security baseline:** Scan existing data upon first enabling Defender for Storage to establish a baseline for future security.

Malware can infiltrate cloud storage environments and pose significant risks to organizations. On-demand malware scanning provides a built-in, cloud-native solution to detect and mitigate these threats by scanning your existing data for malicious content.

> [!NOTE]
> To cancel an ongoing scan, select **Cancel**. Cancellation is only possible during the initial stages, before all blobs have been sent for scanning. Once the system starts waiting for scan results, the **Cancel** option will no longer be available.

## Using the REST API

### Initiate the scan

To start a malware scan using the REST API, follow these steps:

- **Request URL**:

    ```bash
    POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings/current/startMalwareScan?api-version=2024-10-01-preview
    ```

- **Authentication**:
  - Ensure you obtained a valid bearer token. This is required for API access.

- **Example**:

    ```http
    POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount/providers/Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings/current/StartMalwareScan?api-version=2024-10-01-preview
    Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOi...
    ```

### Check scan status and results

Once a scan starts, you can check the status and review the results using the following commands:

- **Request URL**:

    ```bash
    GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings/current/malwareScans/latest?api-version=2024-10-01-preview
    ```

- **Response example**:

    ```json
    {
      "scanId": "abcd1234-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab",
      "scanStatus": "InProgress",
      "scanStartTime": "2024-10-03T12:34:56Z",
      "scanSummary": {
        "blobs": {
          "totalBlobsScanned": 150,
          "maliciousBlobsCount": 2,
          "skippedBlobsCount": 0,
          "scannedBlobsInGB": 10.5
        },
        "estimatedScanCostUSD": 1.575
      }
    }
    ```

### Cancel a scan

Cancellation of an in-progress scan is only possible during the early stages, before all blobs are sent for scanning. To cancel the scan:

- **Request URL**:

    ```bash
    POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/defenderForStorageSettings/current/malwareScans/latest/cancelMalwareScan?api-version=2024-10-01-preview
    ```

## Cost considerations

Before starting an on-demand scan, the Azure portal provides a cost estimate based on the Blob Capacity metric, updated every few hours. The estimate is shown in USD and reflects the cost per GB scanned. Unlike on-upload scanning, there's no monthly capâ€”costs are entirely based on usage.

### Best practices for cost control

- **Review cost estimates**: Always check the estimated cost in the Azure portal before initiating a scan.
- **Set scanning frequency wisely**: Schedule or automate scans based on risk, focusing on high-priority data to avoid unnecessary costs.
- **Automate efficiently**: Ensure automation triggers scans only when needed, such as in response to specific events or alerts.

## On-demand scanning initiation and process

### Starting a scan

- **Azure portal:** Manually initiate scans from the Defender for Cloud pane within the storage account.
- **REST API:** Trigger scans programmatically using the provided API for more control and automation.
- **Automation via Logic Apps, Automation runbooks, or PowerShell scripts:** Automate scan initiation as part of security workflows or compliance processes using the REST API.

### Scanning process

1. **Scan initiation:** Scans are started manually through the Azure portal, triggered programmatically via API, or automated through Logic Apps, Automation runbooks, or PowerShell scripts.
1. **Cost estimation:** The Azure portal provides an estimated cost for the scan based on the Blob Capacity metric and data volume.
1. **Listing and sending blobs:** Once the scan starts, it begins listing all supported blobs in the storage account and sends them for scanning simultaneously. This stage might take from minutes to hours depending on the number and size of the blobs.
1. **Monitoring progress:** You can track scan progress in the Azure portal or via API. This includes the number of blobs scanned, skipped files (due to limitations), data volume, malicious files detected, scan status, and duration.
1. **Scan completion:** Once all blobs are scanned, the system shows the scan as complete along with a summary of results. In the API, you can query the last scan.
1. **Cancellation:** Cancelling an ongoing scan is only possible during the early stages when blobs are being listed and sent for scanning. Once the system is waiting for scan results, cancellation is no longer possible.

### Important considerations

- **Scan duration**: May take minutes to hours, depending on data size, type, and number of blobs.

- **Single scan limitation**: Only one on-demand scan can run per storage account at a time.

## Best practices

To maximize the effectiveness of on-demand malware scanning in Microsoft Defender for Storage, consider the following recommendations:

- **Integrate with incident response:** Use on-demand scanning to quickly address security incidents by scanning potentially compromised files in response to alerts.
- **Automate compliance scans:** Set up automated, regular scans to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements and audit readiness. Use Logic Apps or runbooks to streamline this process.
- **Set up automated responses to scan results:** Configure automated workflows that respond to malware scan results, such as moving infected files to quarantine or forwarding clean files.
- **Manage costs proactively:** Always review cost estimates provided in the Azure portal before initiating scans, especially for large datasets or frequent scans.
- **Monitor results consistently:** Continuously monitor scan outcomes and security alerts to stay informed about potential threats and take timely action.
