In May 2024 you might experience a decrease in your alerts volume, but still remain protected. If you don't currently have integration enabled, enable it to maintain and improve alert coverage. All Defender for Server customers can access the full value of Defender for Endpoint's integration at no additional cost. [Learn more](enable-defender-for-endpoint.md). |
