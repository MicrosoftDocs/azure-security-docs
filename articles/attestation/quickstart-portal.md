# Quickstart: Set up Azure Attestation by using the Azure portal

Follow this quickstart to get started with Azure Attestation. Learn how to manage an attestation provider, a policy signer, and a policy by using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin. The user creating an attestation provider should have sufficient access levels on the subscription to create a resource (e.g: owner/contributor). For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

## Attestation provider

In this section, you'll create an attestation provider and configure it with either unsigned policies or signed policies. You'll also learn how to view and delete the attestation provider.

### Create and configure the provider with unsigned policies

1. Go to the Azure portal menu or the home page and select **Create a resource**.
1. In the search box, enter **attestation**.
1. In the results list, select **Microsoft Azure Attestation**.
1. On the **Microsoft Azure Attestation** page, select **Create**.
1. On the **Create attestation provider** page, provide the following inputs:

   - **Subscription**: Choose a subscription.

   - **Location**: Choose a location.
   - **Policy signer certificates file**: Don't upload the policy signer certificates file to configure the provider with unsigned policies.

1. After you provide the required inputs, select **Review+Create**.
1. Fix any validation issues and select **Create**.

### Create and configure the provider with signed policies

1. Go to the Azure portal menu or the home page and select **Create a resource**.
1. In the search box, enter **attestation**.
1. In the results list, select **Microsoft Azure Attestation**.
1. On the **Microsoft Azure Attestation** page, select **Create**.
