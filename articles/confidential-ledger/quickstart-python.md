# Quickstart: Microsoft Azure confidential ledger client library for Python

Get started with the Microsoft Azure confidential ledger client library for Python. Follow the steps in this article to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks.

Microsoft Azure confidential ledger is a new and highly secure service for managing sensitive data records. Based on a permissioned blockchain model, Azure confidential ledger offers unique data integrity advantages, such as immutability (making the ledger append-only) and tamper proofing (to ensure all records are kept intact).

[API reference documentation](https://azuresdkdocs.z19.web.core.windows.net/python/azure-confidentialledger/latest/azure.confidentialledger.html) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/confidentialledger) | [Package (Python Package Index) Management Library](https://pypi.org/project/azure-mgmt-confidentialledger/)| [Package (Python Package Index) Client Library](https://pypi.org/project/azure-confidentialledger/)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
[!INCLUDE [Ensure subscription owner](./includes/ensure-subscription-owner.md)].
- Python versions [supported by the Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python#prerequisites).
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

## Set up

This quickstart uses the Azure Identity library, along with Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell, to authenticate user to Azure Services. Developers can also use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to authenticate their calls. For more information, see [Authenticate the client with Azure Identity client library](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme).

### Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [Sign in to Azure](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/confidential-ledger-sign-in-azure.md)]

### Install the packages

In a terminal or command prompt, create a suitable project folder, and then create and activate a Python virtual environment as described on [Use Python virtual environments](/azure/developer/python/configure-local-development-environment?tabs=cmd#use-python-virtual-environments).

Install the Microsoft Entra identity client library:

```terminal
pip install azure-identity
```

Install the Azure confidential ledger control plane client library.

```terminal
pip install azure.mgmt.confidentialledger
```

Install the Azure confidential ledger data plane client library.

```terminal
pip install azure.confidentialledger 
```

### Create a resource group

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group](./includes/confidential-ledger-rg-create.md)]

### Register the microsoft.ConfidentialLedger resource provider

[!INCLUDE [Register the microsoft.ConfidentialLedger resource provider](./includes/confidential-ledger-register-rp.md)]

## Create your Python app

### Initialization

We can now start writing our Python application. First, import the required packages.

```python
# Import the Azure authentication library

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

## Import the control plane sdk

from azure.mgmt.confidentialledger import ConfidentialLedger as ConfidentialLedgerAPI
from azure.mgmt.confidentialledger.models import ConfidentialLedger

# import the data plane sdk

from azure.confidentialledger import ConfidentialLedgerClient
from azure.confidentialledger.certificate import ConfidentialLedgerCertificateClient
```

Next, use the [DefaultAzureCredential Class](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) to authenticate the app.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

Finish setup by setting some variables for use in your application: the resource group (myResourceGroup), the name of ledger you want to create, and two urls to be used by the data plane client library.

  > [!Important]
  > Each ledger must have a globally unique name. Replace \<your-unique-ledger-name\> with the name of your ledger in the following example.

```python
resource_group = "<azure-resource-group>"
ledger_name = "<your-unique-ledger-name>"
subscription_id = "<azure-subscription-id>"

identity_url = "https://identity.confidential-ledger.core.azure.com"
ledger_url = "https://" + ledger_name + ".confidential-ledger.azure.com"
```

### Use the control plane client library

The control plane client library (azure.mgmt.confidentialledger) allows operations on ledgers, such as creation, modification, deletion, listing the ledgers associated with a subscription, and getting the details of a specific ledger.

In the code, first create a control plane client by passing the ConfidentialLedgerAPI the credential variable and your Azure subscription ID (both of which are set above).  

```python
confidential_ledger_mgmt = ConfidentialLedgerAPI(
    credential, subscription_id
)
```

We can now create a ledger using `begin_create`. The `begin_create` function requires three parameters: your resource group, a name for the ledger, and a "properties" object.  

Create a `properties` dictionary with the following keys and values, and assign it to a variable.

```python
properties = {
    "location": "eastus",
    "tags": {},
    "properties": {
        "ledgerType": "Public",
        "aadBasedSecurityPrincipals": [],
    },
}

ledger_properties = ConfidentialLedger(**properties)
```

Now pass the resource group, the name of your ledger, and the properties object to `begin_create`.

```python
confidential_ledger_mgmt.ledger.begin_create(resource_group, ledger_name, ledger_properties)
```

To verify that your ledger was successfully created, view its details using the `get` function.

```python
myledger = confidential_ledger_mgmt.ledger.get(resource_group, ledger_name)

print("Here are the details of your newly created ledger:")
print (f"- Name: {myledger.name}")
print (f"- Location: {myledger.location}")
print (f"- ID: {myledger.id}")

```

### Use the data plane client library

Now that we have a ledger, interact with it using the data plane client library (azure.confidentialledger). 

First, we generate and save a confidential ledger certificate.  

```python
identity_client = ConfidentialLedgerCertificateClient(identity_url)
network_identity = identity_client.get_ledger_identity(
     ledger_id=ledger_name
)

ledger_tls_cert_file_name = "networkcert.pem"
with open(ledger_tls_cert_file_name, "w") as cert_file:
    cert_file.write(network_identity['ledgerTlsCertificate'])
```

Now we can use the network certificate, along with the ledger URL and our credentials, to create a confidential ledger client.

```python
ledger_client = ConfidentialLedgerClient(
     endpoint=ledger_url, 
     credential=credential,
     ledger_certificate_path=ledger_tls_cert_file_name
)
```

We are prepared to write to the ledger. We will do so using the `create_ledger_entry` function.

```python
sample_entry = {"contents": "Hello world!"}
append_result = ledger_client.create_ledger_entry(entry=sample_entry)
print(append_result['transactionId'])
```

The print function will return the transaction ID of your write to the ledger, which can be used to retrieve the message you wrote to the ledger.

```python
entry = ledger_client.get_ledger_entry(transaction_id=append_result['transactionId'])['entry']
print(f"Entry (transaction id = {entry['transactionId']}) in collection {entry['collectionId']}: {entry['contents']}")
```

If you just want the latest transaction that was committed to the ledger, you can use the `get_current_ledger_entry` function.


```python
latest_entry = ledger_client.get_current_ledger_entry()
print(f"Current entry (transaction id = {latest_entry['transactionId']}) in collection {latest_entry['collectionId']}: {latest_entry['contents']}")
```

The print function will return "Hello world!", as that's the message in the ledger that corresponds to the transaction ID and is the latest transaction.

## Full sample code

```python
import time
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

## Import control plane sdk

from azure.mgmt.confidentialledger import ConfidentialLedger as ConfidentialLedgerAPI
from azure.mgmt.confidentialledger.models import ConfidentialLedger

# import data plane sdk

from azure.confidentialledger import ConfidentialLedgerClient
from azure.confidentialledger.certificate import ConfidentialLedgerCertificateClient

# Set variables

resource_group = "<azure-resource-group>"
ledger_name = "<your-unique-ledger-name>"
subscription_id = "<azure-subscription-id>"

identity_url = "https://identity.confidential-ledger.core.azure.com"
ledger_url = "https://" + ledger_name + ".confidential-ledger.azure.com"

# Authentication

# Need to do az login to get default credential to work

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Control plane (azure.mgmt.confidentialledger)
# 
# initialize endpoint with credential and subscription

confidential_ledger_mgmt = ConfidentialLedgerAPI(
    credential, "<subscription-id>"
)

# Create properties dictionary for begin_create call 

properties = {
    "location": "eastus",
    "tags": {},
    "properties": {
        "ledgerType": "Public",
        "aadBasedSecurityPrincipals": [],
    },
}

ledger_properties = ConfidentialLedger(**properties)

# Create a ledger

confidential_ledger_mgmt.ledger.begin_create(resource_group, ledger_name, ledger_properties)

# Get the details of the ledger you just created

print(f"{resource_group} / {ledger_name}")
 
print("Here are the details of your newly created ledger:")
myledger = confidential_ledger_mgmt.ledger.get(resource_group, ledger_name)

print (f"- Name: {myledger.name}")
print (f"- Location: {myledger.location}")
print (f"- ID: {myledger.id}")

# Data plane (azure.confidentialledger)
#
# Create a CL client

identity_client = ConfidentialLedgerCertificateClient(identity_url)
network_identity = identity_client.get_ledger_identity(
     ledger_id=ledger_name
)

ledger_tls_cert_file_name = "networkcert.pem"
with open(ledger_tls_cert_file_name, "w") as cert_file:
    cert_file.write(network_identity['ledgerTlsCertificate'])


ledger_client = ConfidentialLedgerClient(
     endpoint=ledger_url, 
     credential=credential,
     ledger_certificate_path=ledger_tls_cert_file_name
)

# Write to the ledger
sample_entry = {"contents": "Hello world!"}
ledger_client.create_ledger_entry(entry=sample_entry)
  
# Read from the ledger
latest_entry = ledger_client.get_current_ledger_entry()
print(f"Current entry (transaction id = {latest_entry['transactionId']}) in collection {latest_entry['collectionId']}: {latest_entry['contents']}")
```

## Pollers

If you'd like to wait for your write transaction to be committed to your ledger, you can use the `begin_create_ledger_entry` function. This will return a poller to wait until the entry is durably committed.

```python
sample_entry = {"contents": "Hello world!"}
ledger_entry_poller = ledger_client.begin_create_ledger_entry( 
    entry=sample_entry
)
ledger_entry_result = ledger_entry_poller.result()
```

Querying an older ledger entry requires the ledger to read the entry from disk and validate it. You can use the `begin_get_ledger_entry` function to create a poller that will wait until the queried entry is in a ready state to view.

```python
get_entry_poller = ledger_client.begin_get_ledger_entry(
    transaction_id=ledger_entry_result['transactionId']
)
entry = get_entry_poller.result()
```

## Clean up resources

Other Azure confidential ledger articles can build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you may wish to leave these resources in place.

Otherwise, when you're finished with the resources created in this article, use the Azure CLI [az group delete](/cli/azure/group?#az-group-delete) command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources:

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group myResourceGroup
```
