# Transition from Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework to Microsoft Azure confidential ledger

Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework (Managed CCF) is being **deprecated** and will no longer receive updates or support.

We recommend that customers transition to [Microsoft Azure confidential ledger (ACL)](overview.md), a fully managed, highly secure ledger service built on trusted execution environments. Azure confidential ledger offers:

- **Tamperproof storage**: Blockchain-backed, ensuring data integrity and immutability.
- **Tamper evidence**: Verify data integrity at any time with cryptographic proofs.
- **Comprehensive security**: Protect data at rest, in transit, and in use with Azure confidential computing.
- **Simplified management**: Built-in high availability and seamless integration with Azure services.

Azure confidential ledger also supports server-side programming, such as functions and endpoints, allowing you to pre- and post-process ledger data or run simple applications directly on the ledger. Learn more at [Azure confidential ledger server-side programming](server-side-programming.md).

For more information, visit the [Azure confidential ledger product page](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-confidential-ledger) or the [Azure confidential ledger overview](overview.md).
