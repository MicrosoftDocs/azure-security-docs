# Quickstart: Create a confidential ledger using the Azure CLI

Azure confidential ledger is a cloud service that provides a high integrity store for sensitive data logs and records that must be kept intact. In this quickstart, you use the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/) to create a confidential ledger, view and update its properties, and delete it.

For more information on Azure confidential ledger and examples of what can be stored in a confidential ledger, see [About Microsoft Azure confidential ledger](overview.md).

## Create a resource group

[!INCLUDE [Create resource group](../../includes/cli-rg-create.md)]

## Get your principal ID

To create a confidential ledger, you need your Microsoft Entra principal ID (also called your object ID). To obtain your principal ID, use the Azure CLI [az ad signed-in-user](/cli/azure/ad/signed-in-user) command, and filter the results by `objectId`:

```azurecli
az ad signed-in-user show --query objectId
```

Your result is in the format `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.

## Create a confidential ledger

Use the Azure CLI [az confidentialledger create](/cli/azure/confidentialledger#az-confidentialledger-create) command to create a confidential ledger in your new resource group.

```azurecli
az confidentialledger create --name "myLedger" --resource-group "myResourceGroup" --location "EastUS" --ledger-type "Public" --aad-based-security-principals ledger-role-name="Administrator" principal-id="<your-principal-id>"
```

A successful operation returns the properties of the newly created ledger. Take note of the **ledgerUri**. In our example, this URI is "https://myledger.confidential-ledger.azure.com".

You need this URI to transact with the confidential ledger from the data plane.

## View and update your confidential ledger properties

You can view the properties associated with your newly created confidential ledger using the Azure CLI [az confidentialledger show](/cli/azure/confidentialledger#az-confidentialledger-show) command.

```azurecli
az confidentialledger show --name "myLedger" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
```

The returned JSON object displays the ledger's properties, including your role:

```json
"ledgerRoleName": "Administrator",
```

To update the properties of a confidential ledger, use do so, use the Azure CLI [az confidentialledger update](/cli/azure/confidentialledger#az-confidentialledger-update) command. For instance, to update your ledger to change your role to "Reader", run:

```azurecli
az confidentialledger update --name "myLedger" --resource-group "myResourceGroup" --ledger-type "Public" --aad-based-security-principals ledger-role-name="Reader" principal-id="<your-principal-id>" 
```

If you again run [az confidentialledger show](/cli/azure/confidentialledger#az-confidentialledger-show), you see that the role is updated.

```json
"ledgerRoleName": "Reader",
```
