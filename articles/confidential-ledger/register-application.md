# How to register an Azure confidential ledger application with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article you'll learn how to integrate your Azure confidential ledger application with Microsoft Entra ID, by registering it with the Microsoft identity platform.  

The Microsoft identity platform performs identity and access management (IAM) only for registered applications. Whether it's a client application like a web or mobile app, or it's a web API that backs a client app, registering it establishes a trust relationship between your application and the identity provider, the Microsoft identity platform. [Learn more about the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription and permission to manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A Microsoft Entra tenant. [Learn how to set up a tenant](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant).
- An application that calls Azure confidential ledger.

## Register an application

Registering your Azure confidential ledger application establishes a trust relationship between your app and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: your app trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around.

Follow these steps to create the app registration:

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">Azure portal</a>.
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.
1. Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. Enter a display **Name** for your application. Users of your application might see the display name when they use the app, for example during sign-in.
   You can change the display name at any time and multiple app registrations can share the same name. The app registration's automatically generated Application (client) ID, not its display name, uniquely identifies your app within the identity platform.
1. Specify who can use the application, sometimes called its _sign-in audience_.

1. Don't enter anything for **Redirect URI (optional)**. You'll configure a redirect URI in the next section.
1. Select **Register** to complete the initial app registration.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/portal-02-app-reg-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal in a web browser, showing the Register an application pane.":::

When registration finishes, the Azure portal displays the app registration's **Overview** pane. You see the **Application (client) ID**. Also called the _client ID_, this value uniquely identifies your application in the Microsoft identity platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> New app registrations are hidden to users by default. When you are ready for users to see the app on their [My Apps page](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510) you can enable it. To enable the app, in the Azure portal navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Enterprise applications** and select the app. Then on the **Properties** page toggle **Visible to users?** to Yes.

Your application's code, or more typically an authentication library used in your application, also uses the client ID. The ID is used as part of validating the security tokens it receives from the identity platform.

:::image type="content" source="./media/portal-03-app-reg-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal in a web browser, showing an app registration's Overview pane.":::

## Add a redirect URI

A _redirect URI_ is the location where the Microsoft identity platform redirects a user's client and sends security tokens after authentication.

In a production web application, for example, the redirect URI is often a public endpoint where your app is running, like `https://contoso.com/auth-response`. During development, it's common to also add the endpoint where you run your app locally, like `https://127.0.0.1/auth-response` or `http://localhost/auth-response`.

You add and modify redirect URIs for your registered applications by configuring their [platform settings](#configure-platform-settings).

### Configure platform settings

Settings for each application type, including redirect URIs, are configured in **Platform configurations** in the Azure portal. Some platforms, like **Web** and **Single-page applications**, require you to manually specify a redirect URI. For other platforms, like mobile and desktop, you can select from redirect URIs generated for you when you configure their other settings.

To configure application settings based on the platform or device you're targeting, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, in **App registrations**, select your application.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.
1. Under **Platform configurations**, select **Add a platform**.
1. Under **Configure platforms**, select the tile for your application type (platform) to configure its settings.

1. Select **Configure** to complete the platform configuration.

### Redirect URI restrictions

There are some restrictions on the format of the redirect URIs you add to an app registration. For details about these restrictions, see [Redirect URI (reply URL) restrictions and limitations](/azure/active-directory/develop/reply-url).

## Add credentials

Credentials are used by [confidential client applications](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-client-applications) that access a web API. Examples of confidential clients are web apps, other web APIs, or service-type and daemon-type applications. Credentials allow your application to authenticate as itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime.

You can add both certificates and client secrets (a string) as credentials to your confidential client app registration.

:::image type="content" source="./media/portal-05-app-reg-04-credentials.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal, showing the Certificates and secrets pane in an app registration.":::

### Add a certificate

Sometimes called a _public key_, a certificate is the recommended credential type because they're considered more secure than client secrets. For more information about using a certificate as an authentication method in your application, see [Microsoft identity platform application authentication certificate credentials](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials).

1. In the Azure portal, in **App registrations**, select your application.
1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Certificates** > **Upload certificate**.
1. Select the file you want to upload. It must be one of the following file types: _.cer_, _.pem_, _.crt_.
1. Select **Add**.

### Add a client secret

Sometimes called an _application password_, a client secret is a string value your app can use in place of a certificate to identity itself.

Client secrets are considered less secure than certificate credentials. Application developers sometimes use client secrets during local app development because of their ease of use. However, you should use certificate credentials for any of your applications that are running in production.

1. In the Azure portal, in **App registrations**, select your application.
1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**.
1. Add a description for your client secret.
1. Select an expiration for the secret or specify a custom lifetime.
    - Client secret lifetime is limited to two years (24 months) or less. You can't specify a custom lifetime longer than 24 months.
    - Microsoft recommends that you set an expiration value of less than 12 months.
1. Select **Add**.
1. _Record the secret's value_ for use in your client application code. This secret value is _never displayed again_ after you leave this page.
