      - question: |-  
          What is Azure Cloud HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          Microsoft Azure Cloud HSM is a service that provides secure storage for cryptographic keys by using hardware security modules (HSMs) that meet the FIPS 140-3 Level 3 security standard. It's a customer-managed, single-tenant, highly available service that complies with industry standards.
          
          Azure Cloud HSM supports various applications, including PKCS#11, offloading of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) processing, certificate authority (CA) private key protection, and transparent data encryption (TDE). It also supports document and code signing.
          
          Azure Cloud HSM provides high availability and redundancy by grouping multiple HSMs into a cluster and automatically synchronizing across three HSM instances. The HSM cluster supports load balancing of cryptographic operations. Periodic HSM backups help ensure secure and simple data recovery. For more information, see [What is Azure Cloud HSM?](overview.md).
      - question: |-  
          What is an HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          A hardware security module (HSM) is a physical computing device that's designed to protect and administer cryptographic keys. Within HSMs, keys are securely stored and used for cryptographic operations. Tamper-resistant and tamper-evident hardware modules help ensure the confidentiality and integrity of those keys. Access to the keys is restricted to authenticated and authorized applications, so the key material always remains within the protected boundary of the HSM. For more information, see [Secure your Azure Cloud HSM deployment](secure-cloud-hsm.md).
      - question: |-  
          What hardware is used for Azure Cloud HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          Azure Cloud HSM uses Marvell LiquidSecurity hardware security modules. For more information about service specifications, see [Azure Cloud HSM service limits](service-limits.md).
      - question: |-  
          What software is provided with Azure Cloud HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          Microsoft supplies all software and tools for Azure Cloud HSM through its SDK. You can download the Azure Cloud HSM SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftAzureCloudHSM/releases). For more information about integration options, see [Azure Cloud HSM integration guides](integration-guides.md).
      - question: |-  
          Do I need to manage the firmware on my HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          No, Microsoft oversees the firmware on the hardware. A third party (the HSM manufacturer) maintains the hardware. NIST evaluates the firmware and must sign it to ensure compliance with FIPS 140-3 Level 3 standards. For more information about hardware management, see [What is Azure Cloud HSM?](overview.md).
      - question: |-  
          How do I decide whether to use Azure Cloud HSM or Azure Managed HSM?
        answer: |- 
          Azure offers multiple solutions for cryptographic key storage and management in the cloud: Azure Key Vault (standard and premium offerings), Azure Managed HSM, Azure Cloud HSM, and Azure Payment HSM. It can be overwhelming for customers to decide which solution is best for them. A flowchart, based on common high-level requirements and key management scenarios, is available to help customers make this decision. See [How to choose the right key management solution](/azure/security/fundamentals/key-management-choose).
      - question: |-  
          What usage scenarios best suit Azure Cloud HSM?
        answer: |
          Azure Cloud HSM is best suited for migration scenarios, when you're migrating on-premises applications that are already using HSMs to Azure. Azure Cloud HSM provides a low-friction option to migrate to Azure with minimal changes to the application.
          
          If cryptographic operations are performed in an application's code running in an Azure virtual machine or web app, an organization can use Cloud HSM. In general, shrink-wrapped software running in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) models that support HSMs as a key store can use Cloud HSM. This software includes:
            - Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).  
            - SSL/TLS offloading for NGINX and Apache.  
            - Tools and applications used for document signing.  
            - Code signing.  
            - Java applications that require a Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provider.  
            - Microsoft SQL Server TDE (IaaS) through Extensible Key Management (EKM).  
            - Oracle TDE.  
          
          For more information about implementing these scenarios, see [Azure Cloud HSM integration guides](integration-guides.md).
      - question: |-  
          Can Azure Cloud HSM host my HSMs for me?
        answer: |- 
          No. Microsoft doesn't support "bring your own HSM." Azure Cloud HSM can't host any customer-provided devices. For more information about the service architecture, see [What is Azure Cloud HSM?](overview.md).
      - question: |-  
          Can I migrate my keys in Azure Dedicated HSM to Azure Cloud HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          Yes, but it depends on your architecture and configuration. If your Dedicated HSM deployment is configured in a high-availability (HA) grouping, you can't migrate keys. The reason is that key export is disabled to allow for key cloning (HA grouping), and changing those attributes is a destructive process. If your Dedicated HSM deployment is configured in an HA grouping, you must create new keys when migrating to Azure Cloud HSM. For more information about key management, see [Key management in Azure Cloud HSM](key-management.md).
  
  - name: Customer onboarding  
    questions:  
      - question: |-

    questions:
      - question: |-
          Can I restore a backup to the source Azure Cloud HSM resource?
        answer: |-
          No. You can't restore a backup to its source Azure Cloud HSM resource because it's in an activated state. For more information about backup and restore operations, see [Backup and restore in Azure Cloud HSM](backup-restore.md).
      - question: |-
          Can I restore a backup to another destination Azure Cloud HSM resource that's in an activated state?
        answer: |-
          No. Azure Cloud HSM doesn't support restoring a backup to its source HSM or any Cloud HSM resource that's already activated. Otherwise, the restore operation will fail and put the destination Cloud HSM resource in a nonfunctional state. For more information about the restoration process, see [Restoration guidelines for Azure Cloud HSM](backup-restore.md).
      - question: |-
          Can I restore a backup to another Azure Cloud HSM resource in a different region?
        answer: |-
          Yes. You can restore a backup to another Azure Cloud HSM resource in any region, if the destination Cloud HSM resource is not in an activated state. For more information about cross-region restoration, see [Cross-region recovery for Azure Cloud HSM](backup-restore.md#initiate-a-restore-to-the-destination-cloud-hsm-resource).
      - question: |-
          Can I create more than one managed identity per Azure Cloud HSM cluster?
        answer: |-
          No. Only one managed identity is allowed per Azure Cloud HSM cluster. For more information about identity and access management, see [Apply a managed identity and create a storage account](backup-restore.md#apply-a-managed-identity-and-create-a-storage-account).
      - question: |-
          Can I apply more restrictive read/write permissions for my source and destination for backups?
        answer: |-
          Yes. The minimum role-based access control (RBAC) role required is Storage Blob Data Contributor. You can restrict the source as read-only, but you need read/write permissions on the destination. For more information about access control, see [Apply a managed identity and create a storage account](backup-restore.md#apply-a-managed-identity-and-create-a-storage-account).
  
  - name: Security and compliance  
    questions:  
      - question: |-  
          Do I share my Azure Cloud HSM resource with other Azure customers?  
        answer: |-  
          No. With Azure Cloud HSM, you have exclusive administrative access to your HSM as a single tenant. For more information about the service architecture, see [What is Azure Cloud HSM?](overview.md).
      - question: |-  
          Can Microsoft or anyone at Microsoft access keys in my Azure Cloud HSM resource?  
        answer: |-  
          No. Microsoft does not have any access to the keys stored in customer-allocated HSMs. For more information about security controls, see [Secure your Azure Cloud HSM deployment](secure-cloud-hsm.md).
      - question: |-  
          How does Microsoft manage the HSM without having access to my encryption keys?  
        answer: |-  
          In the architecture of Azure Cloud HSM, separation of duties and role-based access control are fundamental principles. Microsoft does not have any cryptographic control over customer-allocated HSMs or control over the HSM's users, other than its own limited role as appliance user.
          
          Microsoft has restricted permissions to the HSM. These permissions allow monitoring, maintenance of health and availability, encrypted backups, and extraction and publication of immutable audit logs to the customer's specified storage. These permissions don't allow Microsoft to use keys owned by cryptography users to perform cryptographic operations. For more information about operational logging, see [Configure and query operation event logging for Azure Cloud HSM](tutorial-operation-event-logging.md).
      - question: |-  
          Does Azure Cloud HSM store customer data?  
        answer: |-  
          No, Azure Cloud HSM doesn't retain customer data. All key materials and data are housed within the customer's HSM. Each Azure Cloud HSM cluster is exclusively designated for a single customer who has administrative control. For more information about data protection, see [Secure your Azure Cloud HSM deployment](secure-cloud-hsm.md).
      - question: |-  
          Does Azure Cloud HSM support FIPS 140-3 Level 3?  
        answer: |-  
          Yes, Azure Cloud HSM offers HSMs that are validated to meet the FIPS 140-3 Level 3 standards. For procedures to verify the authenticity of your HSM, including checking the [FIPS 140-3 Level 3 certification from NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4700), refer to the [onboarding guide](onboarding-guide.md). For more information about compliance, see [What is Azure Cloud HSM?](overview.md).
      - question: |-  
          Does Azure Cloud HSM support eIDAS? 
        answer: |-  
          Yes. Azure Cloud HSM supports eIDAS compliance under the Austrian scheme by providing secure key management, cryptographic operations, and FIPS 140-3 Level 3 validated hardware to meet stringent requirements for qualified electronic signatures and seals, to help ensure regulatory compliance. Learn more in the [QSCD Certificate](https://www.a-sit.at/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VIG-19-078-QSCD-Certificate-Final_sig-HL.pdf). For more information about security standards, see [Secure your Azure Cloud HSM deployment](secure-cloud-hsm.md).
      - question: |-  
          What happens if someone tampers with the HSM hardware?  
        answer: |-  
          Azure Cloud HSM incorporates both physical and logical tamper detection and response mechanisms that initiate key deletion (zeroization) of the hardware. These measures are designed to detect tampering if the physical barrier is compromised.
          
          Additionally, HSMs are safeguarded against brute-force sign-in attacks. The system locks out cryptography officers (COs) after a set number of unsuccessful access attempts. Similarly, repeated unsuccessful attempts to access an HSM with cryptography user (CU) credentials result in locking out the user. A CO must then unlock the CU. Unlocking a CO requires `getChallenge` and signing the challenge with `PO.key` via OpenSSL, followed by `unlockCO` and `changePswd` commands. For more information about security features, see [Secure your Azure Cloud HSM deployment](secure-cloud-hsm.md).
