It can be overwhelming for customers to decide which key management solution is correct for them. To help customers navigate this decision-making process, a flowchart, based on common high-level requirements and key management scenarios, is available. See [How to choose the right key management solution](/azure/security/fundamentals/key-management-choose).
      - question: |-  
          What usage scenarios best suit Azure Cloud HSM?
        answer: |
          Azure Cloud HSM is the most suitable for migration scenarios, when you are migrating on-premises applications to Azure that are already using HSMs. Azure Cloud HSM provides a low-friction option to migrate to Azure with minimal changes to the application. If cryptographic operations are performed in the application's code running in Azure VM or Web App, Cloud HSM can be used. In general, shrink-wrapped software running in IaaS (infrastructure as a service) models that support HSMs as a key store can use Cloud HSM, such as:
            - ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services)  
            - SSL/TLS Offload for Nginx and Apache  
            - Tools/applications used for document signing.  
            - Code signing.  
            - Java applications that require JCE provider  
            - Microsoft SQL Server TDE (IaaS) through EKM.  
            - Oracle TDE  
          
          For more information about implementing these scenarios, see [Azure Cloud HSM integration guides](integration-guides.md).
      - question: |-  
          Will Azure Cloud HSM host my HSMs for me?
        answer: |- 
          No. Microsoft doesn't support 'Bring Your Own HSM'. Azure Cloud HSM cannot host any customer-provided devices. For more information about the service architecture, see [What is Azure Cloud HSM?](overview.md).
      - question: |-  
          Can my keys in Azure Dedicated HSM be migrated to Azure Cloud HSM?

      - question: |-  
          What happens if someone tampers with the HSM hardware?  
        answer: |-  
          Azure Cloud HSM incorporates both physical and logical tamper detection and response mechanisms that initiate key deletion (zeroization) of the hardware. These measures are designed to detect tampering if the physical barrier is compromised. Additionally, HSMs are safeguarded against brute-force login attacks, with the system locking out Crypto Officers (COs) after a set number of unsuccessful access attempts. Similarly, repeated unsuccessful attempts to access an HSM with Crypto User (CU) credentials result in the user being locked out, requiring a CO to unlock them. Unlocking a CO user requires getChallenge, signing the challenge with your PO.key using OpenSSL, followed by unlockCO and changePswd commands.
