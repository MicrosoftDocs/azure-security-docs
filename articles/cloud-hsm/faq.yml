        answer: |-  
          Microsoft Azure Cloud HSM is a service that provides secure storage for cryptographic keys using hardware security modules that meet the FIPS 140-3 Level 3 security standard. It's a customer-managed single-tenant, highly available service that is compliant with industry standards. Microsoft Azure Cloud HSM provides secure and customer-managed HSM for storing cryptographic keys and performing cryptographic operations. It supports various applications, including PKCS#11, offload SSL/TLS processing, certificate authority private key protection, and transparent data encryption, including document and code signing. Microsoft Azure Cloud HSM provides high availability and redundancy by grouping multiple HSMs into an HSM cluster and automatically synchronizing across three HSM instances. The HSM cluster supports load balancing of cryptographic operations, and periodic HSM backups ensure secure and simple data recovery.
      - question: |-  
          What is a hardware security module (HSM)?  
        answer: |-  
          A hardware security module (HSM) is a physical computing device designed to protect and administer cryptographic keys. Within HSMs, keys are securely stored and used for cryptographic operations, ensuring their confidentiality and integrity through tamper-resistant and tamper-evident hardware modules. Access to the keys is restricted to authenticated and authorized applications, ensuring that the key material always remains within the protected boundary of the HSM.
      - question: |-

      - question: |-  
          Do I need to manage the firmware on my HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          No, Microsoft oversees the firmware on the hardware. A third party (HSM manufacturer) maintains the hardware, while the firmware is evaluated and must be signed by NIST to ensure compliance with FIPS 140-3 Level 3 standards.
      - question: |-  
          How do I decide whether to use Azure Cloud HSM or Azure Managed HSM?
        answer: |- 
          Azure offers multiple solutions for cryptographic key storage and management in the cloud: Azure Key Vault (standard and premium offerings), Azure Managed HSM, Azure Cloud HSM, and Azure Payment HSM. It can be overwhelming for customers to decide which key management solution is correct for them. To help customers navigate this decision-making process, a flowchart, based on common high-level requirements and key management scenarios, is available. See [How to choose the right key management solution](/azure/security/fundamentals/key-management-choose).
      - question: |-  
          What usage scenarios best suit Azure Cloud HSM?
        answer: |
          Azure Cloud HSM is the most suitable for migration scenarios, when you are migrating on-premises applications to Azure that are already using HSMs. Azure Cloud HSM provides a low-friction option to migrate to Azure with minimal changes to the application. If cryptographic operations are performed in the application's code running in Azure VM or Web App, Cloud HSM can be used. In general, shrink-wrapped software running in IaaS (infrastructure as a service) models that support HSMs as a key store can use Cloud HSM, such as:
            - ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services)  
            - SSL/TLS Offload for Nginx and Apache  
            - Tools/applications used for document signing.  
            - Code signing.  
            - Java applications that require JCE provider  
            - Microsoft SQL Server TDE (IaaS) through EKM.  
            - Oracle TDE  
      - question: |-  
          Will Azure Cloud HSM host my HSMs for me?
        answer: |- 
          No. Microsoft doesn't support 'Bring Your Own HSM'. Azure Cloud HSM cannot host any customer-provided devices.
      - question: |-  
          Can my keys in Azure Dedicated HSM be migrated to Azure Cloud HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          Yes, it depends on your architecture and configuration. If your Dedicated HSM is configured in HA grouping, then you cannot migrate keys as Key Export is disabled to allow for Key Cloning (HA Grouping) and it's a destructive process to change those attributes. Customers configured in a HA Grouping must create new keys when migrating to Azure Cloud HSM.

          Can Microsoft or anyone at Microsoft access keys in my Azure Cloud HSM?  
        answer: |-  
          No. Microsoft does not have any access to the keys stored in customer allocated HSMs.  
      - question: |-  
          How does Microsoft manage the HSM without having access to my encryption keys?  
        answer: |-  
          In the architecture of Azure Cloud HSM, separation of duties and role-based access control are fundamental principles. Microsoft does not have any cryptographic control over customer allocated HSMs or control over the HSM's users other than its own limited Appliance User. Microsoft possesses restricted permissions to the HSM, allowing monitoring, maintenance of health and availability, encrypted backups, and extraction and publication of immutable audit logs to the customers specified storage. Microsoft's permissions on the HSM do not allow it to use CU-owned keys to perform cryptographic operations.  
      - question: |-  
          Does Azure Cloud HSM store customer data?  
        answer: |-  
          No, Azure Cloud HSM doesn't retain customer data. All key materials and data are housed within the customer's HSM. Each Azure Cloud HSM cluster is exclusively designated for a single customer, granting them sole administrative control.

Refer to the onboarding guide for procedures to verify the authenticity of your HSM, including checking the [FIPS 140-3 Level 3 certification from NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4700).
      - question: |-  
          Does Azure Cloud HSM support eIDAS? 
        answer: |-  
          Yes, Azure Cloud HSM supports eIDAS compliance under the Austrian scheme by providing secure key management, cryptographic operations, and FIPS 140-3 Level 3 validated hardware to meet stringent requirements for qualified electronic signatures and seals, ensuring regulatory compliance. Learn more in the [QSCD Certificate](https://www.a-sit.at/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VIG-19-078-QSCD-Certificate-Final_sig-HL.pdf).
      - question: |-  
          What happens if someone tampers with the HSM hardware?  
        answer: |-  
          Azure Cloud HSM incorporates both physical and logical tamper detection and response mechanisms that initiate key deletion (zeroization) of the hardware. These measures are designed to detect tampering if the physical barrier is compromised. Additionally, HSMs are safeguarded against brute-force login attacks, with the system locking out Crypto Officers (COs) after a set number of unsuccessful access attempts. Similarly, repeated unsuccessful attempts to access an HSM with Crypto User (CU) credentials result in the user being locked out, requiring a CO to unlock them. Unlocking a CO user requires getChallenge, signing the challenge with your PO.key using OpenSSL, followed by unlockCO and changePswd commands.
