# Quickstart: Deploy Azure Cloud HSM by using the Azure portal

[Azure Cloud HSM](overview.md) is a highly available, FIPS 140-3 Level 3 validated single-tenant service that enables you to deploy hardware security modules (HSMs) by using various methods. These methods include the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), Terraform, or the Azure portal. This quickstart guides you through the deployment process in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- Appropriate permissions to create resources in your subscription, including the ability to create HSM resources and managed identities.
- For production environments, an existing virtual network (VNet) and subnet for configuring [private endpoints](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview).

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have a VNet and subnet ready, you can still create the HSM first and add network connectivity later, but using private endpoints is strongly recommended for production environments, as described in [Network security](network-security.md).

## Create an Azure Cloud HSM instance

To create an Azure Cloud HSM instance via the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for and select **Cloud HSM**.
3. Click **Create**.

## Configure basic settings

1. Select your Azure subscription.
2. Choose an existing resource group or create a new one. It's recommended to deploy your Cloud HSM resources in a separate resource group from your related client virtual network and virtual machine resources for better management and security isolation.
3. Specify the HSM name, region, and SKU.
4. Keep the default Domain Name Reuse setting as "Tenant Reuse" to prevent malicious subdomain takeover and ensure the FQDN can only be reused within your tenant.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The HSM name must be unique. If you specify an HSM resource name that already exists in the chosen region, your deployment will fail.

## Configure a managed identity (optional)

By default, Azure Cloud HSM is set to "No Identity" since it primarily uses password-based authentication with user management handled directly on the HSM. However, for backup and restore operations, you'll need a Managed Service Identity (MSI).

Consider the following options:

1. **No identity (default)** - Choose this if you don't plan to use backup and restore operations.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/cloud-hsm-portal-3.png" lightbox="./media/cloud-hsm-portal-3.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the identity configuration page showing the No Identity (default) option selected for Cloud HSM.":::

2. **User-assigned identity** - Recommended for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR). Each Cloud HSM cluster can have only one MSI, but you can use the same MSI for multiple HSMs or assign different ones.

For detailed instructions on configuring a user-assigned identity for backup and restore operations, see [Apply a managed identity and create a storage account](backup-restore.md#apply-a-managed-identity-and-create-a-storage-account).

## Set up networking (recommended)

For secure connectivity, establish a private endpoint to your Azure Cloud HSM. This requires an existing VNet.

1. Select the subscription containing your VNet.
2. Select your VNet and subnet.
3. Configure the DNS integration settings as needed.

> [!TIP]
> Private endpoints are crucial for security as they enable secure connections to your Azure Cloud HSM through a private link, ensuring traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses the Microsoft backbone network. This eliminates exposure to the public internet, as described in [Network security](network-security.md).

## Add tags and review (optional)

Tags are name/value pairs that help organize and categorize resources for management and reporting. This step is optional but recommended for resource organization, especially in enterprise environments.

## Deploy your Cloud HSM resource

1. Review all HSM details, including managed identity and networking settings.
2. Click **Create** to begin provisioning your Azure Cloud HSM resource.
3. The portal will display "Deployment is in progress" while resources are being created.

When the deployment finishes, you'll see "Your deployment is complete" in the portal.

## Initialize and configure your HSM

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Azure Cloud HSM activation and configuration cannot be performed through the portal. You must use the Azure Cloud HSM SDK and Client Tools, which you can download from GitHub.

After deployment, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Download and install the Azure Cloud HSM SDK** from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftAzureCloudHSM/releases) on a VM that has network connectivity to your HSM.
2. **Initialize and configure your HSM** following the detailed steps in the [Azure Cloud HSM Onboarding Guide](onboarding-guide.md).
3. **Establish user management** with appropriate crypto officers and crypto users, as described in [User management in Azure Cloud HSM](user-management.md).
4. **Implement proper key management practices** to ensure optimal security and performance, as outlined in [Key management in Azure Cloud HSM](key-management.md).

## Clean up resources

If you created a resource group solely for this quickstart and don't need to keep these resources, you can delete the entire resource group through the Azure portal:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group containing your Cloud HSM.
2. Select **Delete resource group**.
3. Enter the resource group name to confirm deletion and select **Delete**.

## Troubleshoot common deployment problems

If you encounter problems during deployment:

- **Resource name conflicts**: Ensure your HSM name is unique in the region. If deployment fails with a naming conflict, try a different name.
- **Network connectivity problems**: Ensure your VM has proper network access to the HSM. Review [Network security](network-security.md) for best practices.
- **Authentication failures**: Verify you're using the correct credentials format as detailed in [Authentication in Azure Cloud HSM](authentication.md).
- **Client connection errors**: Check if the Azure Cloud HSM client is running and properly configured. See [Troubleshoot Azure Cloud HSM](troubleshoot.md) for common client connection problems.
